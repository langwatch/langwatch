# LangWatch Product Context

## What is LangWatch?

LangWatch is an observability and testing platform for LLM-powered applications.

**Core capabilities:**
1. **Observe** - Track traces, costs, and latency of LLM calls
2. **Evaluate** - Score outputs against criteria (deterministic or LLM-judged)
3. **Simulate** - Test agent behavior with scenario-based testing

## Value Proposition

### "Transform 'maybe it works' into 'I know it behaves.'"

LangWatch ensures agents:
- **Succeed** - Complete user intent (booking, refund, etc.)
- **Obey** - Stay within behavioral and policy guardrails
- **Resist** - Handle divergent, confused, or aggressive input
- **Act** - Execute correct tool calls at the correct time

## Platform Areas

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Traces** | View LLM call traces, costs, latency |
| **Evaluations** | Judge existing data against criteria |
| **Scenarios** | Simulate agent behavior with behavioral specs |
| **Prompts** | Manage versioned prompt configurations |
| **Workflows** | Build multi-step agent workflows |

## Deployment

- Hosted SaaS and self-hosted options
- Deployed on AWS
- PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis infrastructure
