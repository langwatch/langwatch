# Documentation

Project documentation referenced by agents and humans.

## Files

- **BEST_PRACTICES.md** - Testing, TypeScript, React, file organization
- **design/** - UI component design system

## Also See

- `TESTING.md` (root) - Test hierarchy and BDD workflow
- `AGENTS.md` (root) - Common LLM mistakes to avoid

## Writing Docs

Be token-conscious. Agents and developers can google standard practices - only document:
- Project-specific decisions
- Links to external standards (not explanations of them)
- Quick references for project-specific patterns
