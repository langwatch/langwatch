/**
 * What every test in this package needs before it renders anything.
 *
 * The shape `@langwatch/gateway-web` introduced and every governed web package
 * since has stated for itself: `@testing-library/jest-dom` for the DOM matchers
 * the moved suites were written against, and the browser APIs jsdom does not
 * ship that Chakra's overlays reach for on the way to positioning themselves.
 * A missing `ResizeObserver` surfaces as an unhandled rejection out of an
 * animation frame rather than as a failure, so a shard fails with its own
 * summary all green.
