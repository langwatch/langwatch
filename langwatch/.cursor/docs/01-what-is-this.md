# AI-Assisted Documentation Guide

## Purpose

This documentation folder serves as a knowledge base for the AI assistant (Claude) to better understand the LangWatch project's architecture, design decisions, and implementation details. The goal is to maintain a high-level understanding of the system that complements the codebase itself, focusing on the "why" rather than the "how" of implementation details.

## Documentation Structure

Each document in this folder will:
- Focus on specific aspects or features of the product
- Explain architectural decisions and their rationales
- Provide navigation guidance to relevant code sections
- Highlight important patterns and conventions
- Document key design decisions and their context
- Avoid duplicating implementation details that are better understood from the code

## How to Use These Docs

When working on the project:
1. Start with the relevant documentation file to understand the context
2. Use the documentation as a map to locate relevant code sections
3. Refer to implementation details in the actual codebase
4. Update documentation when significant architectural changes occur

## Documentation Principles

1. **Context Over Code**: Focus on explaining why decisions were made rather than how they were implemented
2. **Navigation Over Duplication**: Instead of copying code snippets, provide clear pointers to relevant files and modules
3. **Architecture Over Implementation**: Describe system architecture, patterns, and relationships between components
4. **Living Documentation**: These docs should evolve alongside the codebase, capturing new decisions and changes in direction
5. **AI-Optimized**: Written specifically to help the AI assistant quickly understand complex aspects of the system

## File Naming Convention

- Files are prefixed with numbers (e.g., `01-`, `02-`) to maintain a logical reading order
- Names should be descriptive and indicate the content (e.g., `03-authentication-flow.md`)
- Use kebab-case for file names

## What NOT to Include

- Detailed implementation code (reference the actual code files instead)
- Configuration details that might change frequently
- Information that can be directly inferred from reading the code
- Duplicated information from other documentation sources

## Updating Documentation

The AI assistant will:
1. Create new documentation files when implementing significant features
2. Update existing documentation when architectural changes occur
3. Maintain cross-references between related documentation files
4. Keep the documentation focused and relevant

This documentation structure aims to minimize the cognitive load when returning to work on different parts of the system while ensuring that important context and decisions are preserved and easily accessible.
