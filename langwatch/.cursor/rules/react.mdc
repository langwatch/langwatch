Typescript Development Guidelines:

1. Documentation
   - Add TSDoc style documentation when writing functions, methods and components.
   - Always include "Single Responsibility" in the description

2. React Rules
   - Keep business logic in hooks, not inline in the component markup.

3. Imports
   - Always use named imports for React components and hooks.
   - Never use non-destructured imports, such as `React.useMemo` or `React.useCallback`.
