React Component Development Guidelines:

1. Component Structure
   - Create smaller, focused components
   - Compose larger components from smaller ones
   - When prototyping, keep small components in the same file, but mark to be removed:
   ie: 

/**
 * ExampleComponent
 * Responsibilities: 
 * To be an example component
 * 
 * TODO: Move to a separate file
 */
function ExampleComponent() {
  return <div>ExampleComponent</div>;
}


2. Hook Organization
   - Break complex logic into smaller hooks
   - Compose hooks when it makes sense
   - Keep hooks in the same file as their components

3. Code Separation
   - Separate business logic from UI rendering
   - Keep related code together
   - Maintain clear boundaries between concerns

4. Documentation
   - Add TSDoc style documentation when write functions and components.
   - Always include "Single Responsibility" in the description
