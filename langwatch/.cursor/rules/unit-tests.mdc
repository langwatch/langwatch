description: When proposing/writing unit tests
alwaysApply: false

Stack:
- Vitest

Rules:
- Only test logic (if/else statements); do not test interfaces, return values, or UI components directly. Business logic in hooks should be tested.
- Avoid testing internal implementation details; only test the public API.
- One assertion per test.
- Each logical branch ("when") should be a separate describe block.
- When proposing tests, suggest todo items only. Write actual tests only after specs are confirmed.
- Place tests in a `__tests__` directory as close as possible to the code under test.
- Only test if/then logic.
- Always flag any potential bugs found during logic assessment.

Example:
```ts
describe("Todo List", () => {
    describe("when a todo is added", () => {
        it.todo("adds a todo");
    });
});
```
