Stack:
- Vitest

Rules:
- All logic, and ONLY logic should be tested - "logic" is only if/else statements. Do not test interfaces, returns, etc.
- Avoid testing internal implementation details
- Avoid testing UI componentsa - business logic should be in hooks and testable.
- One assertion per test.
- The concept of "when" is a logical branch and should be its own describe block.
- When writing tests, you should propose todo items only, until the user confirms the specifications are complete and correct, then you may ask to write the tests.
