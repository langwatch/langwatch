# Solve Full Ticket

When implementing a feature or fixing a bug, follow this complete workflow:

## Branch Management
1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name using the format:
   - `feature/description-of-feature` for new features
   - `fix/description-of-bug` for bug fixes
   - `refactor/description-of-change` for refactoring
   - `docs/description-of-update` for documentation updates

## Implementation
2. Implement the complete solution, ensuring:
   - All requirements are met
   - Code follows existing patterns and conventions
   - Proper error handling is included
   - Edge cases are considered
   - 

## Commit Standards
3. Make commits using conventional commit format

## Quality Assurance
4. Before pushing:
   - Ensure code compiles without errors
   - Run existing tests to verify no regressions
   - Add new tests if applicable
   - Review code for best practices
   - Alert the user if there are any errors or warnings before pushing the branch.

## Deployment
5. Push the branch to remote repository for review and integration

This ensures a complete, professional development workflow that maintains code quality and project standards.
