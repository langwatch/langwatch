/**
 * ADR-032 R3 (v6): pure policy for the heavy browser→storage direct upload.
 *
 * Heavy files upload directly to a server-owned staging key; the size cap is
 * enforced at *finalize* (HEAD the staged object) — no new dependency (the S3
 * impl uses the already-installed `s3-request-presigner`). A POST-policy that
 * rejects before bytes land (`createPresignedPost`) is deferred hardening.
 *
 * This module is deliberately provider-agnostic: it owns only the staging-key
 * scheme, the size cap and the presign TTL. The SDK wrappers (presigned PUT,
 * HEAD, delete) live in `S3DatasetStorage`, which composes these helpers.
