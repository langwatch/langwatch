 * Replays a single goose ClickHouse migration file against a live client.

 * Integration tests that cover an upgrade path need to place the schema in
 * the state an earlier migration left it in, write data there, and then
 * apply a later migration to that data. The goose runner cannot do this
 * (it only moves the whole version table forward), so this helper executes
 * the Up section of one migration file directly: it splits the file on the
 * goose statement markers and substitutes the same environment variables
 * goose's runner injects (see buildMigrationEnvVars in ../goose.ts).
 *
 * Only the variables the replayed migrations use are supported; an
 * unrecognised `${...}` placeholder throws instead of reaching ClickHouse.
