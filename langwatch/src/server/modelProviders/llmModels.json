      "description": "Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview is Google’s frontier reasoning model, delivering enhanced software engineering performance, improved agentic reliability, and more efficient token usage across complex workflows. Building on the multimodal foundation of the Gemini 3 series, it combines high-precision reasoning across text, image, video, audio, and code with a 1M-token context window. Reasoning Details must be preserved when using multi-turn tool calling, see our docs here: The 3.1 update introduces measurable gains in SWE benchmarks and real-world coding environments, along with stronger autonomous task execution in structured domains such as finance and spreadsheet-based workflows. Designed for advanced development and agentic systems, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview improves long-horizon stability and tool orchestration while increasing token efficiency. It introduces a new medium thinking level to better balance cost, speed, and performance. The model excels in agentic coding, structured planning, multimodal analysis, and workflow automation, making it well-suited for autonomous agents, financial modeling, spreadsheet automation, and high-context enterprise tasks.",

Reasoning effort can be adjusted with the `reasoning.effort` parameter. Read the Codex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup.

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality. In internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.",

It introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining output quality. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. The model was trained under conditions aligned with V3.1-Terminus to enable direct comparison. Benchmarking shows performance roughly on par with V3.1 across reasoning, coding, and agentic tool-use tasks, with minor tradeoffs and gains depending on the domain. This release focuses on validating architectural optimizations for extended context lengths rather than advancing raw task accuracy, making it primarily a research-oriented model for exploring efficient transformer designs.",

The model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required. It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.",

It targets complex tasks across reasoning, code generation, knowledge QA, and multilingual use, while remaining robust on alignment and formatting. Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought. The model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.",

It leverages a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture paired with a custom \"lightning attention\" mechanism, allowing it to process long sequences—up to 1 million tokens—while maintaining competitive FLOP efficiency. With 456 billion total parameters and 45.9B active per token, this variant is optimized for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Trained via a custom reinforcement learning pipeline (CISPO), M1 excels in long-context understanding, software engineering, agentic tool use, and mathematical reasoning. Benchmarks show strong performance across FullStackBench, SWE-bench, MATH, GPQA, and TAU-Bench, often outperforming other open models like DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B.",

Notes on Pricing ([Source](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#detailed-pricing-breakdown-for-sonar-deep-research)) - Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches) - Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step. - Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens",

The model features three adjustable reasoning effort levels and supports key developer capabilities including function calling, structured outputs, and streaming, though it does not include vision processing capabilities. The model demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor, with expert testers preferring its responses 56% of the time and noting a 39% reduction in major errors on complex questions.
