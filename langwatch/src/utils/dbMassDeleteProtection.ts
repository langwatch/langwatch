 * These middleware specifically do NOT guard in the case of a nested find, update, delete.
 * These middleware also don't protect in the case of an undefined variable being passed in alongside a specific condition.
 *
 * Ex: {
 *    id, // undefined
 *    otherAttr: null
 * }
 *
 * The above where clause will delete/modify/find all regardless of undefined status of variable appId.
 *
 * The !! best !! guard here is proper type adherence - do not bang, do not coerce.
