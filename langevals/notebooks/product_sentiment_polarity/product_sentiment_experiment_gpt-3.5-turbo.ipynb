It captures a wide spectrum of sentiments, ranging from very positive to subtly negative, often comparing devices to competitors or predecessors. The language is professional and technical, balancing detailed specifications with real-world applications, making it well-suited for training sentiment analysis models to understand nuanced consumer feedback and competitive comparisons in the tech review domain.\\n\\nProposed Instruction: You are given `output`, which is an in-depth review or commentary on high-end smartphones from brands such as Google Pixel, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and OnePlus. Your task is to analyze this review to produce two fields: `reasoning` and `sentiment`.\\n\\n1. **Reasoning**: Extract the core arguments, evidences, and justifications provided in the review. This should include detailed assessments of features such as chipset performance, battery longevity, camera quality, build design, and any comparisons made with other smartphone models.\\n2. **Sentiment**: Determine the overall sentiment of the review towards the smartphone. This can range from very positive to subtly negative. Pay attention to the nuanced language and phrases that indicate the reviewer's satisfaction or dissatisfaction.\\n\\n**Ensure that the reasoning is precise and adequately supports the identified sentiment. Maintain a professional and technical tone in your output to reflect the style of the reviews.**\"\n",

    "General notes about the experiment:\n",
    "1. For MIPRO and COPRO optimizations, the given training dataset was too small. Better results could potentially be achieved with more data and a bigger budget available.\n",
    "2. The quality of the whole dataset is not verified as it was artificially created by an LLM. Although it fully suffices for the primary goal of this experiment - to verify if DSPy optimizers can actually improve the results. Experiments with human-LLM interaction datasets would be interesting to explore in future trials. Additionally, experiments with human-made answers should be explored in the next experiments.\n",
    "3. For simplicity, the task was defined as a basic classification, and the requirement for \"reasoning\" or \"positive_points\" and \"negative_points\" was lifted. It is worth exploring further how priming would affect the final decision of an LLM.\n",
    "4. As the documentation of the DSPy library does not cover all the details, not all of the optimizers were used with optimal input parameters. The selection of most input parameters was based on the examples given in the [DSPy Cheatsheet](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/cheatsheet). We believe that certain optimizers could show better accuracy if the input parameters were chosen more thoroughly."
