LangWatch is an Open-Platform for **Observing**, **Evaluating** and **Optimizing** your LLM and Agentic applications. We offer:

- [**Observability**](https://docs.langwatch.ai/integration/overview) - Add tracing to your LLM, based on the OpenTelemetry standard, allowing LangWatch to provide real-time powers.
- [**Evaluation**](https://docs.langwatch.ai/llm-evaluation/offline-evaluation) - Run real-time and offline evaluations against production or synthetic datasets. Compare performance across various matrixes (prompts, modules, hosting providers, and complete LLM pipelines).
- [**Datasets**](https://docs.langwatch.ai/features/datasets) - Automatically created from traced messages, or upload, datasets which can be used across the platform for evals.
- [**Optimization Studio**](https://docs.langwatch.ai/optimization-studio/overview) ‚Äì Build and run evaluations faster with our no+lo üßò code studio. If you need more flexibility, you have access to the DSL that powers it too.
- **Prompt Management & Optimization** ‚Äì Version prompts, test changes on datasets, and improve real-world performance. Auto-optimize with DSPy's MIPROv2 to generate better prompts and few-shot examples.
- [**Annotations**](https://docs.langwatch.ai/features/annotations) - Human in the Loop, done right. Accelerate better data creation by combining domain expert input with smart workflows. Use LangWatch's intuitive annotation interface to collaborate directly with experts while keeping full control over your code. Quickly generate high-quality labels, catch edge cases, and fine-tune datasets to build more accurate, robust AI models.

LangWatch is framework- and LLM-agnostic, with support for (LangGraph, DSPy, Langflow, Flowise, and others) and LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, Bedrock, Gemini, Deepseek, Groq, MistralAI, VertexAI, LiteLLM, and others) via [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

Our use of **open**, and **community-driven** **standards** is all about supporting your business decisions, and enabling your teams to be flexible to the rapidly changing AI ecosystem without worrying about compatibility.

## üö¢ Deploying LangWatch

### Local setup üíª

Get up and running in under 30 seconds. The example below uses Docker, but if you prefer helm charts check out the instructions here.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langwatch/langwatch.git
cp langwatch/.env.example langwatch/.env
docker compose up -d --wait --build
open http://localhost:5560
```

You'll be launched right into our onboarding flow. Welcome aboard ü´°.

### Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

### Other Flavours üç¶

<details>
<summary>Self-hosted (OnPrem) ‚öìÔ∏è</summary>
LangWatch offers a fully self-hosted version of the platform for companies that require strict data control and compliance, complete with Azure AD support.

Read more about it on our [docs](https://docs.langwatch.ai/self-hosting/overview).
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hybrid (OnPrem data) üîÄ</summary>
LangWatch offers a hybrid setup for companies that have strict data control and compliance requirements, without needing to go fully on-prem.

Read more about it on our [docs](https://docs.langwatch.ai/hybrid-setup/overview).
</details>
<details>
<summary>Local Development üë©‚Äçüíª</summary>
You can also run LangWatch locally without docker to develop and help contribute to the project.

Start just the databases using docker and leave it running:

```bash
docker compose up redis postgres opensearch
```

Then, on another terminal, install the dependencies and start LangWatch:

```bash
make install
make start
```
</details>

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get observing in minutes. Now you have an account and have created a project inside LangWatch, lets get your messages flowing through LangWatch.

> [!NOTE]  
> Not using Python or OpenAI? Don't worry, we have your back . [Visit our docs](https://docs.langwatch.ai/integration/overview) for full guides for other popular languages, LLM providers, and frameworks.

### Install and configure SDK

Available for install via `pip`, or `uv`. The SDK will also check your environment variables by default for your API key and endpoint.

```bash
pip install langwatch
```

```python
LANGWATCH_API_KEY="sk-lw-..."

# This is only needed if you aren't using LangWatch Cloud.
# LANGWATCH_ENDPOINT="https://self-hosted-url.internal/"
```

### Create your first trace and auto-instrument OpenAI

```python
import langwatch
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

@langwatch.trace()
def main():
    langwatch.get_current_trace().autotrack_openai_calls(client)
    ...
```

### See your traces in LangWatch
