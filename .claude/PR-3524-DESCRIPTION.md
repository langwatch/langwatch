## Current status (iter34+ — 2026-05-04)

> **Scope**: this PR is the LangWatch AI Governance Platform — a unified org-level control plane (workspaces, sessions, no-spy mode, pull-mode framework, anomaly detection, ingestion sources, OCSF/SIEM export) layered on the AI Gateway data plane, plus the persona-aware chrome that makes both surfaces coexist for end-users / members / admins.

> **🚨 Pre-merge blockers** (orchestrator-flagged 2026-05-04 — **all resolved 2026-05-04**):
> 1. ~~**Governance-reactor pipeline smoke**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** (`987a19bfc` 2026-05-04). Real pipeline smoke is green; reactors were always writing rows. The smoke script polled with `seeded.org.id` but `TenantId` in these CH tables is the project id, not the org id — every prior "0 rows" observation was a polling-query artifact. **Final clean-rerun evidence** captured under §Smoke evidence below: project `proj_smoke_02997d1c84126ee7`, gateway trace `b4cd050fb2259376cbdcbe7bad490631`, ingestion-source trace `f8cdd0c7b2085bb4e5ec4e6ad392774d`, all three CH tables `landed=true rowCount=1`, semantic correctness verified per row. **Diagnosis arc preserved as history** (5 false trails: "reactors absent" / "staged but not executing" / "foldState attrs missing" / "stale code" / "rerun without throw" — all chasing a non-bug); the lesson is **verify your `TenantId` predicate against the actual CH table schema BEFORE spending hours on reactor-internals hypotheses**. Reactor SEMANTICS were always proven (`gatewayBudgetSync.reactor.integration.test.ts` 5/5 real PG+CH); reactor GATING was always correct (gatewayBudgetSync → gateway traces; governanceKpisSync + governanceOcsfEventsSync → ingestion-source traces).
> 2. ~~**Live `IngestionSourceComposer` capture**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** (`01bd0dfb9` 2026-05-04). Lane-B captured the live composer (`admin/ingestion/02-composer-puller-copilot-studio.png` + `03-composer-puller-schedule.png`) using the same temporary `useActivePlan` override pattern Lane-B used in iter 157 (Phase 5 enterprise-gating browser-QA). Override fully reverted in the same session before commit (verified `git diff` clean on `langwatch/src/hooks/useActivePlan.ts`); no override committed. Plus 13 sibling captures across all four UI dogfood phases (P8 sessions / P9 no-spy / P10 ingestion / P11 cli-handoff) — see §Screenshots grid for the full landed-cell list.

### §Smoke evidence — Phase 7 production-pipeline 3-reactor smoke (`987a19bfc` 2026-05-04)

Canonical end-to-end evidence that the trace-processing pipeline correctly fans out fold events through all three governance reactors and lands rows in their respective CH tables. Captured by `langwatch/scripts/dogfood/smoke-3-reactors.ts` against the local Go gateway (`:5563`) + workers stack post-`987a19bfc` smoke-script `TenantId` fix.

**Run identifiers**:
- Project (TenantId): `proj_smoke_02997d1c84126ee7`
- Gateway trace: `b4cd050fb2259376cbdcbe7bad490631`
- Ingestion-source trace: `f8cdd0c7b2085bb4e5ec4e6ad392774d`

**Table landings**:

```json
{
  "gateway_budget_ledger_events": { "landed": true, "rowCount": 1 },
  "governance_kpis":               { "landed": true, "rowCount": 1 },
  "governance_ocsf_events":        { "landed": true, "rowCount": 1 },
  "overall": "ALL_LANDED"
}
```

**Sample row evidence** (semantic correctness verified, not just row presence):

| Table | Sample fields |
|---|---|
| `gateway_budget_ledger_events` | `GatewayRequestId=req_d762ee01496d08a7`, `AmountUSD=0.000004`, `TokensInput=12`, `TokensOutput=4`, `Model=gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, `Status=success` |
| `governance_kpis` | `SourceId=ingsrc_smoke_201b12fb`, `SpendUsd=0.000009`, `PromptTokens=25`, `CompletionTokens=8`, `HourBucket=2026-05-04 11:00:00` |
| `governance_ocsf_events` | `ClassUid=6003` (API Activity), `CategoryUid=6`, `ActivityId=6`, `TypeUid=600306`, OCSF v1.1.0 envelope, `RawOcsfJson` populated with full OCSF spec shape |

**Reproducibility**: re-run via `pnpm tsx langwatch/scripts/dogfood/smoke-3-reactors.ts` after a fresh `make dev` + `make service svc=aigateway`. The script seeds a smoke project + ingestion source, fires both a gateway trace + ingestion-source trace, polls the three CH tables by `TenantId = projectId`, and emits the JSON summary above.

#### §Live-fire dogfood evidence — real openai/gpt-5-mini through the gateway (`eb91c075f` 2026-05-04)

Distinct from the Phase-7 synthetic-OTLP smoke above. The smoke proves reactor-handler logic against pre-stamped synthetic spans; this run proves the **full chain end-to-end** with real LLM completions:

```
curl POST :5563/v1/chat/completions
 → Bifrost → OpenAI (real chatcmpl-* + req_*)
 → gateway OTel stamp (langwatch.virtual_key_id + langwatch.gateway_request_id)
 → trace_summaries fold (TotalCost from real cost catalog)
 → gatewayBudgetSync reactor (PRINCIPAL-scope applicableForRequest)
 → gateway_budget_ledger_events INSERT (BudgetId+GatewayRequestId tuple, matching trace cost)
```

**Run identifiers**:
- VK: `vk_XDc7r6c5-VM-slajDpMk3g` / `lw_vk_live_01KQSRG0J9Y04DSBVQGJ4Y7Z51`
- Org: `kfdwbfXJpF0IrP_zkKiF_` (persona p4 admin: `alexis-dogfood@acme.invalid`)
- Budget: `budget_dogfood_sergey_live` ($1/MONTH PRINCIPAL-scope)

**Evidence**:
- 5 real `trace_summaries` rows totaling $0.000195 across persona-p4's personal project
- 2 real `gateway_budget_ledger_events` rows on the PRINCIPAL-scope budget, BudgetId+GatewayRequestId tuple matching trace cost

**What this proves beyond Phase-7 synthetic smoke**:
- The gateway actually **stamps** the `langwatch.virtual_key_id` + `langwatch.gateway_request_id` OTel attributes the reactor reads (via `services/aigateway/internal/otel/attrs.go`) — Phase-7 smoke fed pre-stamped synthetic spans, this run produces them from a real chat completion.
- Real cost-catalog enrichment at trace-time (post-iter72 PG-debit cutover) — the `TotalCost` on `trace_summaries` was computed from the live cost catalog, not a fixture.
- Real PRINCIPAL-scope budget resolution via `applicableForRequest` — was a suspected failure point during the morning smoke-pivot debug arc, now confirmed working end-to-end.

> **Review-thread closures** (2026-05-04):
> - **Backend lane** (Sergey): all 6 review threads resolved. 5 of 6 were stale — already fixed by prior commits and verified against current code (`abd5fe5c6` personalUsage CH nested-aggs ×2 critical / `49f81be4f` personalVirtualKey 409 + personalWorkspace P2002 race / `0bf5781c4` organization captureException). Only 1 real new fix in `1d71faccd` for spendSpike CodeQL dead-store (`let dispatchTag = "log_only"` → `let dispatchTag: string;`).
> - **UI lane** (Alexis): notification-toggles thread closed in `59aef6bcc` — entire `<SectionCard title="Notifications">` block dropped (no Prisma model, no router, no endpoint backed it; per @rchaves "no mocks in UI" rule, honest empty state = section gone, NOT disable+apology copy). 2 files / 1 insertion / 86 deletions, type-clean. Browser-verified at `/me/settings`: page renders Profile + Personal API Keys + Budget cards only.

> **Branch state — MERGEABLE ✅** (post-`2dc1fc0d4` 2026-05-04, Sergey):
> - GitHub `mergeable=CONFLICTING` → **`MERGEABLE`** ✅; merge state `BLOCKED` only on branch-protection-reviews + pending CodeQL Analyze.
> - Strategy: switched from rebase to merge after `git rebase origin/main` hit conflicts on commit 1/398 (`schema.prisma` + `project.factory.ts` modified repeatedly across 398 commits — per-commit replay would conflict on the same files dozens of times). This branch already uses merge for main-integration (cf. `f5d371f79` 'iter29 rebase pivot').
> - Three-way merge auto-resolved cleanly with **zero manual conflicts**. Three overlap files: `.gitignore` (main added MCP env-var leak defense lines, no overlap); `MainMenu.tsx` (main renamed beta tooltip 'Traces v2' → 'Trace Explorer', no overlap); `gatewayBudgetSync.reactor.{integration,unit}.test.ts` (main-wide PascalCase normalization `lastEventOccurredAt` → `LastEventOccurredAt`; auto-merge picked main's name, verified consistent across all 7 other reactor unit tests + foldProjection definition).
> - Push: fast-forward from `59aef6bcc` → `2dc1fc0d4` (no force needed). Review-fix commits all preserved + visible in `git log`.
>
> **CI status** (as of `96a4b1041` 2026-05-04 — fresh CI wave running on the post-fix HEAD):
> - **`docs-ci check_links`**: 🟡 prompt-swallow fix shipped (`2c9cf46b1`) + 5 actual broken links fixed (`f53989615`). Prompt-swallow: Mintlify CLI in fresh CI runner prompts before producing output, exits nonzero from inside `$()` under `set -eo pipefail`, kills the step before broken-links report runs; fix pipes `continue\n` + `|| true` + drives pass/fail from output strings. Real broken links surfaced once the swallow cleared: 5 stale references to legacy `/ai-gateway/governance/ingestion-sources` path across 4 files (`personal-keys.mdx`, `retention.mdx`, `s3-custom.mdx`, `trace-vs-activity-ingestion.mdx` ×2) — repointed at the canonical `/ai-governance/ingestion-sources/index` post-Phase-6 location. Local: `printf 'continue\n' | npx mintlify broken-links` → success.
> - **`sdk-javascript-ci`**: 🟡 fix shipped (`18b257331`). Phase 11 governance-wrapper e2e files: dropped `as string` cast on `req.headers.authorization` (`@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-assertions`); added `vitest.governance-e2e.config.mts` to `tsconfig.eslint.json` include (eliminates `parserOptions.project` parse error). Local: `pnpm lint` → 0 errors.
> - **`es-migration-e2e`**: 🟡 two fixes shipped (`ab4e3efbd` + `96a4b1041`). (1) CH migration version 22 collision (main shipped `00022_mix_trace_summary_and_eval_runs_col_casing.sql`; PR-side had `00022_add_trace_source_type.sql`); renumbered PR-side to `00029_add_trace_source_type.sql` (next free after `00028_add_ocsf_schema_version`). (2) `@ee/*` alias miss in `langwatch/packages/es-migration/tsconfig.json` (paths block had `~/*` + `@app/*` but not `@ee/*`); `packages/es-migration/src/app.ts` → `~/server/event-sourcing/.../spanStorage.store.ts` → `@ee/governance/services/governanceContentStrip.service` was throwing `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Mirrored alias from root + workers tsconfigs (`@ee/* → ../../ee/*` in this package). Same class as `40c7a4bbc` vite/workers alias miss — captured as recurring lesson under §Process learning below.
> - **`langwatch-app-ci feature-parity`**: 🟡 fix shipped (`30a84d243`). 2 unbound scenarios in `specs/ai-gateway/cli-token-revoke-on-deactivation.feature` (lines 72 + 79). Bound to `auth-cli-budget-status.integration.test.ts` (`returns 401 — unknown / expired tokens are rejected`) + `cliTokenRevocation.service.integration.test.ts` (`deletes both token keys and the per-user index`) via `/** @scenario ... */` JSDoc annotations. Scanner gotcha captured (proximity scanner stops at first non-comment / non-whitespace char — multi-line explanation must be in a separate `/* */` block ABOVE the single-line `/** @scenario */` JSDoc). Local: `pnpm tsx scripts/check-feature-parity.ts` → 2/2 bound ✅.
> - **CodeRabbit `evaluate`**: ❌ unchanged (HTTP 406 `PullRequest.diff too_large`, GitHub's 300-file diff cap). **Automation limit, NOT a product/code failure** — CodeRabbit cannot fetch the full diff for a PR exceeding the cap; reviewers should not read this red as a real CI failure.
> - **CodeQL Analyze**: 🟡 JS/TS still in progress on the fresh CI wave; Go/Python ✅ passed on the prior run.
> - **Branch-protection-reviews**: ⏳ pending rchaves's final review.
>
> 🟡 entries flip to ✅ as the fresh CI wave (running on `96a4b1041`) confirms each fix-SHA lands the failing job green. Orchestrator monitoring; will route any new failure that surfaces.
>
> **Side-effects observed during dogfood** (transparency notes, not blockers):
> - **ClickHouse schema drift caught + fixed**: `trace_summaries.RootSpanType` + `ContainsAi` columns missing in dev-stack despite goose marking migration 0020 applied. Manual `ALTER TABLE` patched it locally; full `DROP DATABASE` + re-run via newly-installed goose binary in app container resolved cleanly. Pre-existing dev-stack inconsistency, **not introduced by this PR**.
> - **Dev RDS migration accidental-deploy**: a `pnpm prisma migrate deploy` invocation from host hit the LANGWATCH-DEV remote RDS (`langwatch-dev-langwatch-pg.cxse2u2amoug...`) instead of local PG, applying the 3 Phase 8/9/10 migrations (`AccessTokenRecord` + `RefreshTokenRecord` device-fingerprint columns + `Organization.maxSessionDurationDays` + `Organization.governanceLogContentMode` + `IngestionSource.errorCount` + `IngestionSource.pullSchedule`). Migrations are **additive nullable columns + defaults — safe to land early**. Flagged by Sergey for transparency 2026-05-04. **Implication**: per the project rule "never modify deployed migrations" (CLAUDE.md), these migrations are now immutable history on the dev RDS regardless of when this PR merges. Any subsequent change to those tables MUST be a new migration, not an edit to the existing files.

## Reviewer's quick read — where to start

This PR is large (215+ commits, multi-week, 3-lane). If you have **30 minutes**, walk this trail in order — every step has a single concrete entry point:

1. **The pitch (3 min)** — read the next section below ("What this PR ships"). It's the customer-facing one-paragraph framing; everything else justifies it.
2. **The contract (5 min)** — open `specs/ai-gateway/governance/architecture-invariants.feature`. The unified-substrate decision is *this file*. Everything else is a consequence. Skim sibling `.feature` files to see the BDD trail (26 files in `specs/ai-gateway/governance/`).
3. **The receiver code (5 min)** — `langwatch/src/server/routes/ingest/ingestionRoutes.ts` — both `POST /api/ingest/otel/:sourceId` (span-shaped) and `POST /api/ingest/webhook/:sourceId` (flat) live here as thin wrappers around the shared hardened parser at `langwatch/src/server/otel/parseOtlpBody.ts`. The decision tree in §"Architecture — at a glance" below maps directly to these two paths.
4. **The hidden Governance Project (5 min)** — `langwatch/src/server/governance/governanceProject.service.ts`. The internal-only Project that makes the unified store viable. §"The hidden Governance Project — invariants" below names the Layer-1 + Layer-2 tests that enforce it never leaks to user-facing surfaces.
5. **The fold projections (5 min)** — `langwatch/src/server/event-sourcing/pipelines/trace-processing/reactors/governanceKpisSync.reactor.ts` + `governanceOcsfEventsSync.reactor.ts`. Derived data, rebuildable from `event_log`. KPI reactor feeds anomaly + activity-monitor; OCSF reactor feeds SIEM export.
6. **The persona-aware experience (5 min)** — `specs/ai-gateway/governance/persona-aware-chrome.feature` (BDD contract) + `langwatch/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (the layout swap). Persona-3 (LLMOps majority, ~90% of users) regression-safety invariant is FIRST in the spec file by design.
7. **The dogfood loop (2 min)** — `docs/ai-gateway/governance/admin-setup.mdx#try-it-locally-dogfood-loop` walks the full sign-up → seed-personas → fire-completion → /me/usage flow against your local stack. Reproducible by you, not just the team.

If you have **5 minutes**, skip to step 7 (dogfood loop) and the §Screenshots grid (persona × flow) below.

**What to push back on, if anything:** the `ee/` license-relocation Phase 4 is *deferred to a follow-up PR* per @rchaves vote H — the behavior ships here, the file moves ship next. If you want it done in-PR, flag it and we'll reopen the vote.

## The pitch — what this PR ships

> "Your engineers are running AI through Workato Genies, Claude for Work, Copilot
> Studio agents, Cursor, Claude Code, and a dozen homegrown agents. You have no
> idea who's doing what, what it's costing, or which agent just did 1,000 actions
> at 3 AM on a Saturday. **LangWatch sits above all of it.** We ingest audit data
> from every AI platform you use, proxy the traffic your teams' keys control, run
> anomaly detection and policy enforcement across everything, and give you a
> sandboxed runtime for the agents you really don't trust. **One dashboard, one
> policy engine, one throat for your security team to choke."**

This PR is the **substrate that makes that pitch real**. It introduces:

- **A single unified observability store** for every AI event the customer's
  enterprise generates — application traces (their own apps), proxied gateway
  traffic (their VK-controlled apps), and ingested audit data from third-party
  AI platforms (Cowork, Workato, S3 audit drops, Copilot Studio, OpenAI/Claude
  compliance feeds). All in `recorded_spans` + `log_records` + `trace_summaries`.
  No parallel governance backend.
- **Per-origin retention** so SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act / GDPR / HIPAA-most-uses
  retention obligations don't force operational traces to balloon to 7 years.
- **A hidden internal Governance Project** as the routing/RBAC/retention context
  that makes the unified store viable — never appears in any user-visible Project
  surface, enforced by Layer-1 + Layer-2 invariant tests against live data.
- **Governance fold projections** (`governance_kpis` for KPIs/anomaly,
  `governance_ocsf_events` for SIEM forwarding) on top of the same unified
  store — derived data, rebuildable from `event_log`, single source of truth.
- **Anomaly detection** (spend_spike today, more rule types behind the same
  reactor pattern) that consumes the fold, not raw partition scans.
- **OCSF export** so security teams can pull audit events into Splunk / Datadog
  Security / AWS Security Hub / Sentinel / Elastic Security / Sumo Logic CSE.

**What this PR does NOT ship** (filed-not-abandoned for the next hardening layer):
cryptographic Merkle-root tamper-evidence (the SEC 17a-4 / HITECH-strict bar);
heavyweight SIEM PUSH infrastructure (DLQ + per-org webhook UI + replay).

**Compliance bar shipped**: SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act baseline /
GDPR / HIPAA-most-uses. Compliance bar deferred: SEC 17a-4 / HITECH strict /
EU AI Act high-risk-systems tier (cryptographic tamper-evidence required).

### Reserved attribute namespaces (origin metadata contract)

| Attribute | Source | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `langwatch.origin.kind = "ingestion_source"` | source identity | receiver |
| `langwatch.ingestion_source.id` | source identity | receiver |
| `langwatch.ingestion_source.organization_id` | source identity | receiver |
| `langwatch.ingestion_source.source_type` | source identity | receiver |
| `langwatch.governance.retention_class` | derived/system-owned | receiver from `IngestionSource.retentionClass` |
| `langwatch.governance.anomaly_alert_id` | derived/system-owned | anomaly reactor on flagged spans |

Per master architecture lock: `langwatch.origin.*` is source-of-truth identity;
`langwatch.governance.*` is system-derived. The trace viewer renders both as
read-only system metadata; users cannot supply or edit them.

### Data schemas — what lands in this PR

| Layer | Change | Migration |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres | `Project.kind` (string, default `"application"`, with composite index `(teamId, kind)`) | `20260427030000_add_governance_metadata` |
| Postgres | `IngestionSource.retentionClass` (string, default `"thirty_days"`) | `20260427030000_add_governance_metadata` |
| Postgres | `IngestionSource` model (the per-platform fleet config with HMAC bearer secret + parserConfig) | earlier in branch |
| Postgres | `AnomalyRule` + `AnomalyAlert` | earlier in branch |
| ClickHouse | `gateway_activity_events` table **DROPPED** — was the wrong direction | `00020_drop_gateway_activity_events.sql` |
| ClickHouse | `governance_kpis` fold projection | step 3/3 (in flight) |
| ClickHouse | `governance_ocsf_events` fold projection | step 3/3 (in flight) |

### Source-of-truth vs derived data

- **Source of truth**: `event_log` (append-only, the durability foundation)
  → `recorded_spans` + `log_records` (the unified observability substrate)
- **Derived projections** (rebuildable from `event_log`):
  - `trace_summaries` (existing; per-trace rollup)
  - `governance_kpis` (new in this PR; per-(org, source, hour) rollup)
  - `governance_ocsf_events` (new in this PR; OCSF-shape view)
- **Read APIs**:
  - `/governance` dashboard ← `governance_kpis` + `recordedSpans`/`log_records`
    with origin filter
  - SIEM export ← `governance_ocsf_events` cursor-paginated
  - anomaly reactor ← `governance_kpis` (cheap pre-aggregated)

## Receiver flow — code pointers

### Span-shaped path (`/api/ingest/otel/:sourceId`)

`langwatch/src/server/routes/ingest/ingestionRoutes.ts`:

1. `authIngestionSource(c)` — `Authorization: Bearer lw_is_*` → `IngestionSource`
   (24h grace on rotated secrets).
2. `readOtlpBody(c.req.raw)` — shared parser at `langwatch/src/server/otel/parseOtlpBody.ts`,
   handles gzip/deflate/brotli per `Content-Encoding`.
3. `parseOtlpTraces(body, contentType)` — same shared helper; handles protobuf,
   JSON, and the JSON-then-protobuf-encode fallback path (mirrors the hardened
   `/api/otel/v1/traces` receiver byte-for-byte).
4. `ensureHiddenGovernanceProject(prisma, source.organizationId)` —
   `langwatch/src/server/governance/governanceProject.service.ts`. Single
   central lazy-ensure helper. Idempotent under concurrent first-mint races.
   Throws if the org has no team.
5. `stampOriginAttrs(parsed.request, source)` — appends the five origin
   attributes (above) onto every span in the parsed request, in-place.
6. `getApp().traces.collection.handleOtlpTraceRequest(govProject.id, request, piiRedactionLevel)`
   — the EXISTING trace pipeline. Same handler `/api/otel/v1/traces` calls. The
   receiver does NOT write CH directly.

Response: `202 {accepted, bytes, events, rejectedSpans?, hint?}`. The `hint`
field surfaces only when `bytes > 0 && events == 0` — onboarding-friendly
diagnostic for fresh-admin first-event setup.

### Flat-event path (`/api/ingest/webhook/:sourceId`)

Same file. Mirrors the OTel path with two differences:

1. Body is read as text (no OTLP parse) — the body IS the event payload.
2. `buildWebhookLogRequest(rawBody, source)` constructs a single OTLP
   `IExportLogsServiceRequest` with one `log_record`:
   - `body.stringValue = rawBody`
   - `severityNumber = 9` (INFO)
   - `attributes` carry the same five origin metadata attributes
   - timestamp = now (per-platform adapters override with the source's event
     time when they ship)
3. Handoff via `getApp().traces.logCollection.handleOtlpLogRequest({tenantId: govProject.id, ...})`
   — the EXISTING log pipeline. Same handler `/api/otel/v1/logs` calls.

Per-platform deeper mappers (workato job arrays, S3 DSL parsing, Copilot Studio
Purview event shapes) ship as follow-up adapters that REPLACE
`buildWebhookLogRequest` with their richer per-event shape but keep the same
handoff target.

## The hidden Governance Project — invariants

Per master architecture lock: the hidden Governance Project is an **internal
routing / tenancy artifact only**. It must NEVER appear in any user-visible
Project surface (project picker, project list, `/api/v1/projects`, billing
exports, RBAC role-binding pickers). Layer-1 + Layer-2 invariant tests (below)
codify this.

- **Lifecycle**: lazy-ensured on first IngestionSource mint via
  `ensureHiddenGovernanceProject(orgId)`. Feature-flag activation alone does
  NOT create a Governance Project; only a real governance entity mint triggers
  it. Idempotent under concurrent races.
- **Schema**: `Project.kind = "internal_governance"` (vs default
  `"application"`). Composite index `(teamId, kind)` makes the filter cheap.
- **Layer-1 filter** (single Prisma extension): `PrismaOrganizationRepository.getAllForUser`
  filters `kind: { not: "internal_governance" }`. Bulk of UI consumers funnel
  through `useOrganizationTeamProject` → `getAllForUser` → filtered.
- **Layer-2 filter** (per-consumer assertions): UI-facing Project consumers
  individually assert non-leakage. Codified in `ui-contract.feature`. Live-data
  invariant tests against testcontainers + dogfood org.
- **RBAC**: project-membership is the access-control mechanism. Org admins +
  auditor-role get read access; project members do NOT see governance-origin
  spans in their `/messages`. This is FREE — same RBAC the existing trace
  pipeline already enforces — because governance data lives in a Project.
- **Public-share disabled**: `Project.traceSharingEnabled = false` on the
  Governance Project. Governance spans cannot be public-shared via existing
  trace-sharing UX.

## BDD specs — the executable contract (52 files / ~6,067 LOC across 3 spec roots)

Spec-first, code-follows. Every architectural lock is captured as testable scenarios before the code lands. Specs live in three roots:

- `specs/ai-gateway/governance/` — 30 files. The original architecture-invariants pillar (Phase 7 lock + cross-lane contracts).
- `specs/ai-governance/` — 17 files across 5 sub-dirs (`cli-wrappers/`, `no-spy-mode/`, `personal-portal/`, `puller-framework/`, `sessions/`). Phase 8/9/10/11 surfaces.
- `specs/ai-gateway/wrapper-e2e/` — 5 files (one per wrapped tool: claude/codex/cursor/gemini/opencode). Phase 11 behavioral pins.

### Phase 7 substrate specs (`specs/ai-gateway/governance/`, 30 files)

The architecture-spine specs from the original 3-lane build. Highlights:

| Spec file | Lane | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture-invariants.feature` | 🅑 | Cross-cutting: unified substrate, OTLP-shape per source, hidden Gov Project, origin/governance namespaces, fold derivation, tamper-evidence deferred |
| `ui-contract.feature` | 🅑 | UI: single events feed, shape-aware drill-down, hidden Gov Project filter discipline at every Project consumer, retention dropdown, no project picker on the composer |
| `compliance-baseline.feature` | 🅐 | SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act / GDPR / HIPAA-most-uses coverage; tamper-evidence deferred contract |
| `siem-export.feature` | 🅐 | OCSF v1.1 read API contract; 6 SIEM platforms named as cron-pull targets; thin-layer push only if it stays derived |
| `receiver-shapes.feature` | 🅢 | Per-source OTLP shape (spans for span-shaped, logs for flat feeds); shared hardened parser; receiver as thin wrapper |
| `folds.feature` | 🅢 | `governance_kpis` + `governance_ocsf_events` fold derivation; anomaly reactor reads fold not raw spans; fold rebuild from event_log |
| `retention.feature` | 🅢 | Per-IngestionSource retention class (30d / 1y / 7y); CH TTL enforcement; org plan ceiling |
| `event-log-durability.feature` | 🅢 | Append-only event_log foundation for non-repudiation; folds rebuildable; tamper-evidence deferred |
| `persona-aware-chrome.feature` | 🅑 | Persona-aware chrome contract — sidebar + header per 4 personas; persona-3 regression-invariant FIRST in file; chicken-and-egg fix codified; FF-off split scenarios for two-flag pilot flexibility |
| + 21 more | mixed | RBAC + ingestion-source variants (workato / s3-custom / openai-compliance / claude-compliance / copilot-studio / otel-generic) + anomaly-rules + routing-policies + audit-event API + cli-integrations + budgets + cli-token-revoke + Personal IDE keys (5 sub-files) + composer-drawer + tool-catalog + observability + governance-project invariants |

### Phase 8/9/10 surface specs (`specs/ai-governance/`, 17 files)

| Sub-dir | Files | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions/` | `personal-sessions.feature` + `admin-max-ttl.feature` | 12 scenarios — `/exchange` device-fingerprint capture; list returns enriched metadata for current user only (cross-user isolation); revoke/revokeAll behavior; missing client_info graceful fallback; admin max-TTL enforcement (default unbounded → set → too-old sessions expire on next /refresh) |
| `no-spy-mode/` | `no-spy-mode.feature` | 7 scenarios — three-mode storage behavior (`full` / `strip_io` / `strip_all`); cross-org isolation; non-gateway-origin spans untouched; forward-looking-only mode flips; ADMIN-only permission gate |
| `puller-framework/` | `puller-adapter-contract.feature` + `http-polling.feature` + `s3-polling.feature` + `copilot-studio-reference.feature` | 26 scenarios — framework contract (interface shape + cursor-based pagination + restart-safety + bad-config rejection); http_polling (config validation + multi-page pulls + header template substitution + 5xx retry + 4xx fail-fast); s3_polling (config validation + drain + lex-cursor key resume + parser switching + malformed-file-skipped + credential rotation); copilot_studio reference (one-click admin enable + locked reference config + future-puller pattern) |
| `personal-portal/` | several | Persona-1 portal, tile classes, end-user/admin walkthroughs |
| `cli-wrappers/` | `wrap-login-routing.feature` (Sergey's concrete pin, `d7c59436d`) | 14 scenarios — login config write + env injection + budget pre-flight exit code 2 per tool. **Sister to** `specs/ai-gateway/wrapper-e2e/{claude,codex,cursor,gemini,opencode}.feature` (broader behavioral specs, 27 scenarios). |

### Phase 11 wrapper-e2e specs (`specs/ai-gateway/wrapper-e2e/`, 5 files)

5 feature files (one per wrapped tool) with 27 scenarios total — per-wrapper env-var injection, gateway routing + bearer = personal VK, trace attribution, budget-exhaustion graceful 429, exit-code passthrough. The Phase 11 e2e harness at `typescript-sdk/__tests__/e2e/cli/governance-wrapper.e2e.test.ts` (16/16 passing in 3s) enforces these behaviorally with `wrap-login-routing.feature` as the concrete test-shape pin.

Cross-references: each spec cites siblings rather than duplicating scenarios. The Phase 7 `architecture-invariants.feature` is the canonical source for substrate invariants; Phase 8/9/10/11 specs reference it for fold semantics + RBAC + retention.

**Coverage summary**: each row maps a load-bearing claim from the iter29 banner / pitch to a spec-or-feature-file evidence anchor + a code path + a test (where the criterion is unit-or-integration-testable) + a customer-facing doc page (where applicable). Rows 9 + 10 + 13 also have iter32 dogfood evidence in the dogfood-findings tracker above (chrome walk for 9; FF defaults for 10; live-fire for 13). Row 14 is the only materially-new security improvement caught during CodeRabbit review (`17047a301`); folded here so reviewers see it explicitly named in the load-bearing-claims map rather than buried in the H tracker detail.

### RBAC defense-in-depth — router-layer enforcement (iter32, fix landed `9e373c284`)

> **Status: FIXED in `9e373c284`.** @ai_gateway_sergey_2's iter32 access-gate dogfood pass surfaced a real defense-in-depth gap: the **sidebar gate** (`a85ba27ff`) correctly hid Govern/Gateway for MEMBER, but the **tRPC read endpoints** still gated on `organization:view` — which MEMBER has — instead of the new `governance:view` / `ingestionSources:view` / etc. catalog added in `385c95e89`. **A MEMBER calling those tRPCs directly (curl, browser devtools) succeeded — the catalog declared the model but the routers were never rewired.**
>
> **Mutations were already correct** — they gated on `organization:manage` (admin-only). Only the read paths drifted.
>
> **Router rewire in `9e373c284`** (was → now):
>
> | Endpoint | Before | After |
> |---|---|---|
> | `governance.setupState` | `organization:view` | `governance:view` |
> | `governance.ocsfExport` | `organization:manage` | `complianceExport:view` |
> | `governance.resolveHome` | `organization:view` | **kept** `organization:view` (regression-invariant: MEMBER /home redirect must still work) |
> | `ingestionSources.list/get` | `organization:view` | `ingestionSources:view` |
> | `ingestionSources.{create,update,rotateSecret,archive}` | `organization:manage` | `ingestionSources:manage` |

> | `anomalyRules.{create,update,archive}` | `organization:manage` | `anomalyRules:manage` |
> | `activityMonitor.*` (all 6 procedures) | `organization:view` | `activityMonitor:view` |
>
> **Evidence chain**:
> - **Spec contract**: `compliance-baseline.feature` + `persona-aware-chrome.feature` (ADMIN-only governance access declared)
> - **Catalog source**: `langwatch/src/server/api/rbac.ts` (5 governance Resources × actions, ADMIN bag full, MEMBER + EXTERNAL get only `organization:view`) — `385c95e89`
> - **Router patch**: `9e373c284` — 4 routers re-wired (governance, ingestionSources, anomalyRules, activityMonitor); 5 files / +320/-25
> - **Regression test**: `langwatch/src/server/api/routers/__tests__/governance.rbac.integration.test.ts` (11/11 green) — MEMBER session → `UNAUTHORIZED` on every governance read endpoint; ADMIN session → 200 OK; `resolveHome` stays callable for MEMBER (regression invariant verified)
> - **Browser dogfood evidence (lane-B, @ai_gateway_alexis_2)**: post-fix browser walk verified — MEMBER signed in directly loading `/governance` → "Access Restricted" (UI gate fires, page guard wins); same for `/settings/governance/ingestion-sources` and `/settings/routing-policies`. tRPC layer probed via authenticated MEMBER session against the batched URL: `governance.setupState` 401, `ingestionSources.list` 401, `anomalyRules.list` 401, `activityMonitor.summary` 401 — all match the design (UNAUTHORIZED with "You do not have permission to access this organization resource" body). Screenshots committed to `dev/dogfood-screenshots/iter32-iter33/` (19 PNGs covering admin + MEMBER + persona-1 walks across iter32-iter33). See §"iter32-iter33 dogfood screenshots" below for embedded highlights.
>
> **✅ Closed thread — iter33-only seed gap, fixed in same PR (`d311c2f70`)**: Alexis's MEMBER browser-session probe found `governance.resolveHome` returning `401 UNAUTHORIZED` despite the `9e373c284` carve-out and the 11/11 integration test green for `resolveHome`. **Root cause** (Sergey, iter33): the dogfood `seed-personas.ts` script used raw `prisma.organization.create` and skipped the RoleBinding seed that production goes through via `OrganizationPrismaRepository.createAndAssign` (lines 217-237). Production seeds 2 RoleBindings per new org — ORGANIZATION-scoped + TEAM-scoped, both at the user's role. Without them, `hasOrganizationPermission` fell into the legacy TeamUser fallback which only consults `teamRoleHasPermission` — and `TEAM_ROLE_PERMISSIONS` has no entry for `organization:view` (it's org-level, not team-level). So MEMBER 401'd on every org-scoped procedure, including `resolveHome`. The integration test passed because it explicitly seeded the ORG-scoped RoleBinding in `beforeAll`, exercising the fast path; seed-personas hit the broken legacy fallback. **NOT a platform regression** — production org-create always goes through the service that seeds RoleBindings; only the dogfood script bypassed it. **Fix in `d311c2f70`**: mirror `createAndAssign` in seed-personas (2 RoleBindings per p3/p4 persona, role from teamRole). p1 personal-only unaffected. Backfilled the 2 missing rows for the live MEMBER seed (`sergey-p3-member@test.local`) so existing browser sessions resolve immediately. Typecheck clean. **Verified post-`d311c2f70`** (Alexis, browser session against the live MEMBER seed): `governance.setupState` / `ingestionSources.list` / `anomalyRules.list` / `activityMonitor.summary` all 401 (catalog enforced); `governance.resolveHome` 200 with body `{persona:'project_only', destination:'/<org>/messages', isOverride:false}` — regression-invariant carve-out proven end-to-end. Defense-in-depth fully GREEN.
> - **iter32 tracker entry**: F (folded into the table below)
>
> **Why this matters for the reviewer**: the sidebar gate alone is UI shaping, not authorization. A reviewer auditing for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 RBAC controls needs both the surface gate (B fix `a85ba27ff`) AND the enforcement boundary (`9e373c284`) to claim defense-in-depth. The catalog declared the model in iter29 (`385c95e89`); the router rewire closes the loop. Row #8 of the criterion → evidence map above is updated.

## In-PR fixes tracker (iter32-iter34)

UX bugs surfaced via the live-fire dogfood loop (A–G, I) plus CodeRabbit review-driven critical/major/nitpick fixes (H, wave 1), all closed in this PR. Browser-verified end-to-end where the fix lands user-visible state. Reviewer narrative: every dogfood + automated-review finding got a fix-in-PR or a documented out-of-scope note; no deferred dogfood bugs from the chrome walks.

| | Bug | Lane | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Docs `/governance/{ingestion-sources,anomaly-rules}` route drift (404 for fresh admins clicking through nav) | A | `0f9ccad2c` — 8 doc files corrected to `/settings/governance/...` |
| **B** | GOVERN sidebar entry missing for fresh ORG ADMIN despite the new RBAC catalog | S | `a85ba27ff` — `useOrganizationTeamProject.hasPermission` org-prefix check now recognises all 5 governance resource families (was string-prefix-only on `organization:`) |
| **C** | "Sharing presence" link in `PersonalSidebar` (post-merge add) | B | Resolved by inspection — `PresenceToggle` is `MainMenu`-only by design (no teammates to share with in personal scope), architecturally correct |
| **D** | `/settings/routing-policies` 500 for fresh ORG ADMIN (read path drift) | B | `ff79b951d` — `routingPolicy.list/get` now uses `checkOrganizationPermission('organization:view')` to match `costs/limits/ingestionSources` convention; the hand-rolled `assertOrgMembership` was unreachable due to `skipPermissionCheck`'s sensitive-input meta-rule rejecting `organizationId` before the fallback ran. Code-quality follow-up filed as [#3687](https://github.com/langwatch/langwatch/issues/3687) — `skipPermissionCheck` should throw a typed `PermissionMisconfiguredError` naming the offending key + suggesting `checkOrganizationPermission` |
| **E** | Local dogfood `NotFoundScene` for `/governance` + `/settings/governance/*` despite the gateway flag being on | B (docs-only) | `e303ec709` — `.env.example` `FEATURE_FLAG_FORCE_ENABLE` now lists both `release_ui_ai_gateway_menu_enabled` AND `release_ui_ai_governance_enabled` by default, with a 4-line explainer of the symptom. Two-flag runtime semantic unchanged (still preserves pilot flexibility); only the local-dev default flipped to enable both. `admin-setup.mdx` dogfood loop step 1 also names both flags explicitly |
| **F** | RBAC defense-in-depth gap: sidebar gate (B fix) correctly hid Govern/Gateway for MEMBER but every governance read tRPC was still gating on `organization:view` (which MEMBER has) instead of the new resource-specific catalog (`385c95e89`); MEMBER calling those tRPCs directly leaked governance state | S | `9e373c284` — 4 routers re-wired to resource-specific permissions + new `governance.rbac.integration.test.ts` (11/11 green) proving MEMBER → UNAUTHORIZED on every governance read endpoint, ADMIN → 200, `resolveHome` regression-invariant preserved. iter33 follow-up `d311c2f70` closed the seed-personas RoleBinding gap. Full mapping + evidence chain in §"RBAC defense-in-depth — router-layer enforcement" above |
| **G** | Persona-1 (org-less CLI/IDE dev) bounced to `/onboarding/welcome` on every navigation including direct-load of `/me`; spec says they should land at `/me` | B | `c991006c3` + follow-up `071a416f8` — four surgical edits closing a 4-layer race: (1) `/index` no-org bouncer fired before the persona resolver, (2) `/me` + `/me/settings` absent from `noOrgBouncerRoutes` so `CommandBar`'s global `useOrganizationTeamProject({redirectToOnboarding:true})` won the race, (3) `/me` + `/me/settings` FF gate `enabled:!!project` never fired for persona-1, (4) `DashboardLayout` `LoadingScreen` returned forever when `!organization` regardless of route class — fixed by skipping the org/orgs requirement when `isPersonalScopeRoute=true`; `/` itself also added to `noOrgBouncerRoutes`. Browser-verified end-to-end (post-`071a416f8`) |
| **H** | CodeRabbit review-driven fixes (waves 1+2+3+3b+3c+3d+4: 2 critical + 6 major + 18 minor + 5 nitpick across 11 commits + 1 bonus, **31 findings closed**, 1 stale-confirmed, all verified before fix) | S+B | `abd5fe5c6` + `0bf5781c4` + `fd800485e` + `49f81be4f` + `565be6b63` + `17047a301` + `7007bfa2b` + `d09ab7fa9` + `2942c26a2` + `0ff8ca117` + `982d24437` (+ `a4db4f714` bonus `is80Pct` close-out by lane-B) — see sub-list below |
| **I** | FF-loading flash on 7 governance pages: `/me`, `/me/settings`, `/settings/governance`, `/settings/governance/{ingestion-sources,anomaly-rules,ingestion-source-detail}`, `/settings/routing-policies` gated `if (!enabled) return <NotFoundScene/>` without checking `useFeatureFlag`'s `isLoading` — caused a `NotFoundScene` flash on every cold load until tRPC resolved (~200ms-1s) | B | `f84c3008e` — destructure `isLoading` + return `<LoadingScreen/>` while loading, only `<NotFoundScene/>` when actually disabled. Bonus: dropped leftover `enabled: !!project` from `/settings/routing-policies` (admin-in-empty-org bug, same shape as the iter32 `/me` fix). +57/-32 across 7 files, typecheck clean |
| **J** (2026-05-04 dogfood) | Stale outbox-ledger copy lying about post-iter72 architecture: (1) `/gateway/usage` empty-state read "gateway debits budgets after a completed request" — wrong, the trace-fold reactor projects onto the budget ledger (no PG outbox / debit endpoint anymore); (2) `/gateway/budgets/[id]` had similar "writes the outbox ledger" / "lives on the outbox ledger" copy. UI was lying about the architecture (PG outbox + `/budget/debit` were retired in iter72 trace-fold cutover; UI never updated). | B | `89832cf53` — both copy strings rewritten to trace-fold + ClickHouse budget-ledger phrasing matching the actual data flow. |
| **K** (2026-05-04 dogfood) | Seed-personas dogfood loop silently produced 0 ledger rows: without a personal `GatewayBudget`, the trace-fold `gatewayBudgetSync` reactor's `applicableForRequest` resolves to zero applicable budgets → skips the `gateway_budget_ledger_events` insert → "mint VK → fire completion → see ledger" appears broken even though traces ingest cleanly. Surfaced during the 2026-05-04 live-fire run; documented in `dev/docs/dogfood/governance-live-fire-evidence-2026-05-04.md`. | S | `d579b3776` — seed-personas now auto-creates a PRINCIPAL-scope `$1/MONTH BLOCK` budget right after VK issuance (`principal=user.id`, matching what the reactor's `applicableForRequest` resolves against). Closes the silent dogfood gap; live-fire loop now produces ledger entries end-to-end out of the box. |
| **L** ⏳ (2026-05-04 dogfood discovery) | Micro-cent rounding bug on `/gateway/budgets/[id]`: 5 ledger rows totaling **$0.000165** display as **$0.00 / $1.00 (0%)** — the UI currency formatter rounds to 2 decimals so anything below $0.01 disappears entirely. Below-cent costs are common in gpt-5-mini-class workloads, so this is a real UX hole, not a corner case. Evidence: `admin/budgets/03-live-data.png` (sergey-p3-member personal budget against the seed-personas budget post-`d579b3776`). Fix path: micro-cent precision (5-6 decimals) for sub-cent values, OR a row-count badge so users see "something" is happening. | B | ⏳ in-flight — Alexis investigating spend-display formatter next |
| **M** ⏳ (2026-05-04 dogfood discovery) | `/gateway/usage` empty-state fires despite ledger rows actually existing for the same project. The corrected copy from row J ("trace-fold reactor projects onto budget ledger") renders but the query path beneath isn't returning the 5 ledger rows. Possible causes: project-id resolution mismatch (TenantId vs projectId vs orgId in the query predicate) or window-filter mismatch (timestamps vs `now() - INTERVAL` boundary). Evidence: `admin/usage/02-live-data.png` (same project as the row L capture). | B + S | ⏳ in-flight — diagnose query-path predicate before fix |

### H detail — CodeRabbit review-driven fixes (waves 1+2+3+3b+3c+3d+4)

**Wave 1** (`abd5fe5c6` + `0bf5781c4` + `fd800485e`):

- **`personalUsage.service.ts` — ClickHouse nested-aggregate runtime crash** (🔴 critical, CodeRabbit comment 3144510333+339): `dailyBuckets` + `breakdownByModel` queries used `sum(argMax(TotalCost, UpdatedAt))` inline, which CH 25 rejects with `code 184 ILLEGAL_AGGREGATION` — every `/me/usage` page load would throw at runtime. Fix: hoist per-trace `argMax` into a subquery, aggregate at outer level (matches the working pattern already in `querySummary`). Also documented the model-fanout cost-attribution semantic (multi-model trace contributes its full `TotalCost` to each model in its `Models` array — intentional attribution-by-presence; precise per-call billing lives in the gateway's per-call ledger).
- **`auth-cli.ts` — Redis cluster CROSSSLOT on multi-key dels** (🔴 critical, CodeRabbit comment 3144510348): three sites called `redis.del(deviceCodeKey, userCodeKey)` together. When `REDIS_CLUSTER_ENDPOINTS` is set (prod SaaS), the two keys can land on different hash slots → cluster rejects with CROSSSLOT. Fix: split into two single-key dels at all 3 sites (TTL expiry, denied, approval). One related but unflagged shape — `redis.multi().set(k1).set(k2).exec()` at line 426 — has the same cluster issue and is left for follow-up since it's a different fix shape (MULTI/EXEC across slots).
- **`personalVirtualKeys.ts` + `user.ts` — inline `import("@prisma/client").PrismaClient`** (🟠 major × 2): violated CLAUDE.md "no inline `import()`" rule. Hoisted to top-level `import type`; local helpers switched to named-args object destructuring (`assertOrgMembership({ prisma, userId, organizationId })`).
- **`organization.ts:1057` — silent failure swallowed by `console.warn`** (🟠 major): `PersonalWorkspaceService.ensure()` errors were lost to log noise. Replaced with `captureException` + structured extras (origin/userId/organizationId) for PostHog triage.
- **Nitpick cleanups** (`fd800485e`): 2 unused imports/vars flagged by github-code-quality bot — `randomUUID` in `auth-cli.ts` + `TEAM_ID` / `PROJECT_ID` constants in `auth-cli-budget-status.integration.test.ts`.

**Wave 2** (`49f81be4f` + `565be6b63` close-out):

- **`personalVirtualKey.service.ts:186` — 409 no_default_routing_policy contract** (🟠 major, `49f81be4f`): the service was silently creating a bare VK with null policy when the caller relied on default-policy resolution and no default existed. Spec (`personal-keys.feature` lines 58-63) says 409 with body `{error: "no_default_routing_policy"}` and NO VK created. Added `NoDefaultRoutingPolicyError` class + 409 translation at 2 call sites (`auth-cli /approve` REST + `issuePersonal` tRPC). **Docs-tied** — see "AI Governance docs plan" below for required user-facing copy.
- **`personalWorkspace.service.ts:153` — race-condition on `ensure()`** (🟠 major, `49f81be4f`): concurrent first-mint calls both saw "no existing" → both attempted `team.create` → second hit Prisma P2002 unique-constraint → 500. Fix: try/catch P2002 + re-fetch-winner pattern (mirrors `085d084cb` from `governanceProject.service.ts`).
- **Nitpick cleanups close-out** (`565be6b63` + `a4db4f714` bonus): 3 unused-var nits flagged by github-code-quality bot — `organization` destructure leftover in `MainMenu.tsx` (post-merge edit residue) + `logRequestType` in `parseOtlpBody.test.ts` (pre-existing) + `is80Pct` in `me/index.tsx:59` (folded by Alexis as a bonus during D1+D2). Surgical removals only on peer-touched files.

**Wave 3** (`17047a301` — 5 minors close-out, 1 security-relevant):

- **🛡️ `personalVirtualKey.service.ts` — cross-org policy-binding guard** (🔵 minor but security-relevant): without the guard, a user could pass another org's `policyId` to `issuePersonal` and bind it to their personal VK. Now rejected with `PersonalVirtualKeyNotFoundError`. Logged here as a security improvement caught during automated review (called out in §"Reviewer-proof acceptance criteria → evidence map" row #8 RBAC defense-in-depth).
- **`personalUsage.service.ts queryTopModel` — `arrayJoin(Models)` over RMT counted stale row versions**: fixed with per-trace `argMax` subquery (same pattern as `breakdownByModel` from wave 1). Empirically verified vs CH 25.10.
- **`routingPolicy.service.ts requireOwn` — bare `Error` mapped to 500**: switched to `TRPCError NOT_FOUND`, collapsing "found but wrong org" into the same 404 (denies existence-discovery — small security wedge).
- **`routingPolicy.service.ts resolveDefaultForUser` — unused `userId` param dropped** + 4 call sites cleaned up.
- **`user.personalBudget.integration.test.ts` — docstring/test mismatch**: reframed the docstring to explain case 3 is upstream-covered (tRPC short-circuits before VK lookup).

**Wave 3b** (`7007bfa2b` — 2 more minor findings):

- **`auth-cli.ts:1050` — `instanceof` not string-compare** (🔵 minor, security-adjacent): replaced `err.name === "PersonalVirtualKeyAlreadyExistsError"` with proper `err instanceof PersonalVirtualKeyAlreadyExistsError`. The class is already exported; brittle string compares would break silently under rename or wrapper-class introduction. Small but exactly the kind of thing that erodes auth-error-handling correctness over time.
- **`specs/ai-gateway/governance/cli-login.feature:148` — spec/impl drift on logout**: spec said `POST /api/auth/cli/refresh { revoke: true }` for logout, but the actual implementation at `auth-cli.ts:1156` is `POST /api/auth/cli/logout` which revokes both access and refresh tokens. Spec updated to match impl. **Docs-tied note**: the CLI logout endpoint name is the canonical one; AI Governance docs plan §"cli-debug.mdx" already calls out `POST /api/auth/cli/logout` correctly — no doc change needed. Flagged here so reviewers see spec/impl drift was actively reconciled during review, not left to rot.

**Wave 3c** (`d09ab7fa9` — 2 typescript-sdk minors closing CLAUDE.md rule violations):

- **`typescript-sdk/.../dashboard.ts:38` — inline `import("open")` violated CLAUDE.md "no inline `import()`" rule**: replaced `const open = (await import("open")).default` with top-level `import open from "open"`. Same shape as the `0bf5781c4` Prisma fix; matches the project-wide convention.
- **`typescript-sdk/.../init-shell.ts:50` — cmd.exe metacharacter injection via gateway_url** (security-adjacent): `cmd.exe` treats `&|<>^` as metacharacters; a gateway_url containing a query string with `&` would split when sourced via `init-shell --shell cmd`. Fixed with `set "KEY=value"` cmd-style + `""` quote-escape + CR/LF strip. Mitigation matches CodeRabbit's suggested approach. Counts as a hardening of the CLI shell-init surface for Windows users.

**Wave 3d** (`2942c26a2` — last actionable SDK minor + 1 stale-confirmed verification):

- **`typescript-sdk/.../wrapper.ts:18-23` — `GovernanceConfig` import-type cleanup** (🔵 minor): `GovernanceConfig` is only used as a parameter type in `envForTool`, so it should be `import type` for `verbatimModuleSyntax` / `isolatedModules` correctness. Split out of the value import. Surgical, typecheck-clean. Closes the last open SDK CodeRabbit minor on the lane-S backlog.
- **`budget.unit.test.ts:142` — ANSI-strip regex `/\[/`** (verified-no-change, not a fix): CodeRabbit flagged the regex as missing the ESC escape, but the file already contains a real ESC byte (0x1b) before `[` (invisible in normal `cat`, visible via `od -c`). Functionally equivalent to `/\x1b\[/`; the test is correct as-is. Logged here as a stale-confirmed finding so reviewers see it was investigated, not skipped.
- **Wave 3d-docs** (`0ff8ca117` — 2 docs-side CLI command-name drift fixes, lane-B close-out):
  - `docs/ai-gateway/self-hosting/post-install-checklist.mdx` — `langwatch shell` → `langwatch init-shell` (the actual subcommand name; description corrected from "Subshell" to "Eval-able shell snippet" matching impl).
  - `docs/ai-gateway/governance/personal-keys.mdx` — `langwatch dashboard` → `langwatch me`. Reason: `dashboard` is now the analytics-dashboard CRUD command group (list/get/update); the personal-dashboard command is `langwatch me`. Page stays under `ai-gateway/governance/personal-keys` (one of the 4 retained gateway-side pages).
  - Pre-commit `llms.txt` regenerated clean.

**Wave 4 — UI close-out** (`982d24437` — 1 major + 6 minor across 6 files, lane-B batch):

- **🟠 `me/settings.tsx:65` — notification-toggles not persisted** (major): originally shipped in `982d24437` as a UI-preview soft-gate (disabled checkboxes + "preview only" note) since no backend persistence existed. **Superseded by `59aef6bcc` 2026-05-04**: per @rchaves "no mocks in UI" rule, soft-gate became its own mocked surface — the entire `<SectionCard title="Notifications">` block dropped instead. Honest empty state = section gone. 86-line removal; type-clean. **Persistence-layer follow-up no longer applicable** — there's nothing in the UI to persist.
- **🔵 `me/index.tsx:71-77` — `limitUsd === 0` Infinity% guard** (minor): `(spent/limit)*100` produced `Infinity` (or `NaN` for 0/0). Added `budget.limitUsd > 0 &&` guard on the warning banner; eliminates the bad-render path on a 0-limit budget in warning state.
- **🔵 `BudgetExceededBanner.tsx:52-54` — thousands-separator parity** (minor): module-level `Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", { style: "currency", currency: "USD" })` replaces `$${n.toFixed(2)}` so amounts read `$1,234.56` matching `/me/index.tsx`'s `numeral($0,0.00)` formatting (was rendering `$1234.56` — visually inconsistent across the budget surface).
- **🔵 `settings/routing-policies.tsx:273-322` — per-scope empty-state gate** (minor): the global `editingId !== "new"` guard caused "No policies defined at this scope" to vanish from **every** empty scope the moment the composer opened on **any** scope. Fix: gate per-scope with `!(editingId === "new" && composer?.scope === scope)` so only the scope being edited hides its empty-state.
- **🔵 `me/settings.tsx:417-422` — `createdAt` formatting parity** (minor): `Last used` used `fmtRelative()` but `Created` dumped raw ISO. Wrapped `createdAt` in the same helper so both timestamps read consistently.
- **🔵 `cli/auth.tsx:67` — `router.query.user_code` type-narrowing** (minor): `as string` cast lied — Next.js router-query values are `string | string[] | undefined`. Replaced with defensive normalization that handles all three shapes (single value, array → first element, undefined → blank).
- **🔵 `WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx:269-278` — modifier-key open-in-new-tab** (minor): unconditional `preventDefault()` broke Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click open-in-new-tab. Fix: skip `preventDefault()` when `metaKey || ctrlKey || shiftKey || altKey || button === 1`. Restores standard browser navigation affordances for power users.

typecheck clean across all 7 fixes; each verified against current HEAD by lane-S before sharing the contract.

**Already-fixed items dropped from the open list**: `typescript-sdk/budget.ts:105` + earlier `wrapper.ts:126` were closed by rchaves in `45575b9c4` earlier in the branch; `me/index.tsx:59` `is80Pct` was closed by Alexis's `a4db4f714` D1+D2 bonus. **All CodeRabbit-flagged items across waves 1+2+3+3b+3c+3d+4 resolved; lane-S + lane-B CodeRabbit-triage queue fully closed end-to-end** (24/24 integration tests green post-wave-3 verification: governance.rbac 11/11 + routingPolicy.service 13/13). **Notification-toggles persistence-layer follow-up retired** — superseded by `59aef6bcc` UI drop per "no mocks in UI" rule, so no follow-up to defer.

**Coordination note (room hygiene)**: two intermediate orchestrator pings during the wave 3d-docs handoff carried non-PR content (decorative unicode + external URLs `vestauth.com` / `dotenvx.com` not present anywhere in this branch's diff or in the original CodeRabbit findings). Both peers (lane-S + lane-B) flagged it as cross-talk / injection-shaped. The canonical fix is `0ff8ca117` as cited above; no edits were made matching the bogus text.

## Branch commit history — the unified-trace correction (this branch)

The architecture pivoted mid-branch from a parallel governance-event backend
(`gateway_activity_events` CH table + `activity-monitor-processing` event-sourcing
pipeline) to the unified-trace direction. Honest history:

## Customer-facing surfaces touched by this PR

### Per-platform OTLP-shape mapping (what each source emits, where it lands)

Every governance ingest source picks its OTLP wire shape based on whether the upstream emits span-shaped agent activity or flat audit events:

| Source type | Delivery | OTLP shape | Storage | Drill-down UX | Today's capability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `otel_generic` | Push (HTTP/OTLP) | Spans | `recorded_spans` | Trace viewer | Production-ready |
| `claude_cowork` | Push (HTTP/OTLP) | Spans | `recorded_spans` | Trace viewer | Production-ready |
| `workato` | Webhook → OTLP logs | Logs | `log_records` | Log detail pane | Receiver works; per-platform deeper adapter (job-array unwrap) is follow-up |
| `s3_custom` | S3 replay + callback webhook | Logs | `log_records` | Log detail pane | Receiver works; S3 DSL parsing is follow-up |
| `copilot_studio` | Pull (worker, vendor API) | Logs | `log_records` | Log detail pane | Setup-contract-only; puller worker is follow-up |
| `openai_compliance` | Pull (worker, vendor API) | Logs | `log_records` | Log detail pane | Setup-contract-only; puller worker is follow-up |
| `claude_compliance` | Pull (worker, vendor API) | Logs | `log_records` | Log detail pane | Setup-contract-only; puller worker is follow-up |

**Why two shapes**: spans carry parent-child + duration + status — native fit for multi-step agent activity that benefits from drill-down in the trace viewer. Logs are flat: one event = one row, attributes carry the payload. Forcing flat audit feeds into the span shape requires synthetic `traceId`/`spanId`/duration that carry no information. **One internal pipeline either way** — both shapes pass through the same hardened OTLP parser (`langwatch/src/server/otel/parseOtlpBody.ts:57-159`) and the same trace pipeline downstream.

### Compliance posture (per-framework mapping for the auditor in the room)

| Framework | Coverage in this PR | Mechanism in LangWatch |
|---|---|---|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | ✅ Baseline | Append-only `event_log` (PR #3351 foundation) + per-origin retention class + RBAC via project membership + access logging + org-tenancy isolation |
| **ISO 27001** | ✅ Baseline | Same; documented control mapping (Annex A.12 logging, A.18 compliance) |
| **EU AI Act** (general-purpose tier) | ✅ Baseline | Audit trail durable in `event_log` + retention class meets logging requirements + non-repudiation |
| **GDPR** | ✅ Baseline | Right-to-be-forgotten honoured at retention boundary; org-tenancy isolation; auditor read-only role for DPO access |
| **HIPAA** (most uses) | ✅ Baseline | 7-year archive class (`seven_years`) + RBAC + `event_log` non-repudiation + org-tenancy isolation |
| **EU AI Act** (high-risk tier) | ⏳ Pending follow-up | Same baseline + cryptographic tamper-evidence (named, design locked in `compliance-baseline.feature`) |
| **HIPAA** (covered-entity strict / HITECH cryptographic verification) | ⏳ Pending follow-up | Same + tamper-evidence follow-up |
| **SEC 17a-4** (broker-dealer WORM) | ✗ Out of scope | Requires WORM storage layer + cryptographic verification beyond LangWatch's current model |

**Tamper-evidence is named, not abandoned**: the design (Merkle-root publication of `event_log` digests + customer-rotatable signing keys + verification REST API) is locked in `specs/ai-gateway/governance/compliance-baseline.feature` so it isn't reinvented when a named customer requirement lands. **Why deferred**: the baseline `event_log` already provides non-repudiation for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act general-purpose / GDPR / HIPAA-most-uses without cryptographic publication; we're not over-engineering for hypothetical customers. **What we don't compromise**: the baseline ships in this PR, fully tested, fully spec'd. Tamper-evidence is the only deferred compliance scope.

### In-scope vs out-of-scope (deferral honesty)

| | This PR | Out of scope (named follow-ups) |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Unified observability substrate (recorded_spans + log_records); hidden Governance Project lazy-ensure; origin metadata; reserved namespaces | — |
| **Receivers** | OTLP/HTTP push + generic webhook → OTLP logs adapter (default minimum-shape mapper) | Per-platform deeper webhook adapters (workato job arrays, s3 DSL parsing, copilot_studio Purview shapes); pull-mode workers for copilot_studio + openai_compliance + claude_compliance |
| **Folds** | (Step 3/3, in flight) | governance_kpis + governance_ocsf_events on the unified store |
| **Anomaly reactor** | spend_spike Live; 6 other types Preview (composer accepts, reactor skips with debug log); log-only dispatch | C3 `triggerActionDispatch` (Slack / PagerDuty / SIEM webhook / email); structured threshold-config schema per rule type |
| **OCSF / SIEM** | (Step 3/3, in flight) | Per-org SIEM push UI; DLQ + replay; managed Splunk/Datadog HEC integrations |
| **Compliance** | SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act general-purpose / GDPR / HIPAA-most-uses baseline | Cryptographic tamper-evidence (Merkle-root + signing keys + verification API) |
| **Retention** | Three classes (`thirty_days` / `one_year` / `seven_years`); CH TTL hook (Step 2c, in flight) | Per-source custom retention windows; org-plan ceiling enforcement |
| **UI** | Governance home + composer + secret-reveal modal + per-source detail (unified store) + anomaly composer + project-filter regression | Per-org SIEM push management UI; tamper-evidence verification UI |
| **CLI** | `langwatch governance status`; `langwatch ingest list/health/tail` (read-only) | `langwatch ingest mutate` writes; OCSF push trigger; tamper-evidence verify |
| **Tier 2 / Tier 5** | Control-plane primitives | BYOK endpoint routing runtime; sandboxed-runtime adapter |

### CLI ingest debug surface (lane-A)

Read-only governance debug helpers gated behind `LANGWATCH_GOVERNANCE_PREVIEW=1`. Same backend the web `/governance` and per-source detail page render, exposed via Bearer-auth REST adapters under `/api/auth/cli/governance/*`.

| Command | What it does | Backend |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `langwatch governance status` | Org-level setup-state OR-of-flags (drives MainMenu Govern entry promotion) | `api.governance.setupState` |
| `langwatch ingest list [--all] [--json]` | Org's IngestionSources, active by default | `api.ingestionSources.list` |
| `langwatch ingest health <id> [--json]` | 24h / 7d / 30d events + lastSuccessIso | `api.ingestionSources.healthMetrics` |
| `langwatch ingest tail <id> [--limit N] [--follow] [--json]` | Stream events from unified store, dedup by spanId/eventId | `api.governance.eventsForSource` |

All `--json` modes contract-stable byte-for-byte with the equivalent tRPC procedure. `--follow` polls every 3s with cursor watermark + `seen` Set dedup.

### Documentation updates landed in this PR

- `docs/ai-gateway/overview` — 30-second curl with the new "Don't have a VK yet?" persona-fork callout
- `docs/ai-gateway/quickstart` — explicit developer / admin persona fork at the top
- `docs/ai-gateway/governance/{overview, control-plane, personal-keys, admin-setup, routing-policies, anomaly-rules, cli-debug}` — full governance reading order
- `docs/ai-gateway/governance/ingestion-sources/{index, otel-generic, claude-cowork, workato, s3-custom, copilot-studio, openai-compliance, claude-compliance}` — 8 per-platform pages with brutally honest **Production-ready / Receiver-works / Setup-contract-only** matrix
- `docs/observability/trace-vs-activity-ingestion` — disambiguation page (two URLs, ONE substrate, IngestionSource as origin metadata)

Plus the internal architecture decision record at [`dev/docs/adr/018-governance-unified-observability-substrate.md`](../dev/docs/adr/018-governance-unified-observability-substrate.md) (commit `53a5c4af9`) — captures the parallel-pipeline rip-out, the user directive that triggered it, the 6-point unified-substrate decision, 4 alternatives considered with rejection reasons, the per-source-type wire-shape table, the hidden Gov Project lifecycle diagram, and the branch-correction commit-trace from `f3de1ae07` through `33a8cf6d0`.

## AI Governance docs plan (Phase 6 — top-level docs section build-out)

> **Status**: D1 scaffold + docs.json anchor in flight (lane-B, @ai_gateway_alexis_2). Pages don't ship in this PR; the structure, page outline, screenshot asset map, and cross-link contract do — so reviewers see the full v1 surface and Phase 6 has a clean atomic-task Gantt to execute against post-merge.

### Why a peer-level top-level section, not a sub-section

Today's governance docs live at `docs/ai-gateway/governance/` — useful for the gateway-first reading order, but governance is a peer-level product concern with its own audience (compliance officers, security teams, IT admins) who often don't enter through "AI Gateway" framing. Per @rchaves directive 2026-05-02, governance becomes a **top-level peer of `docs/ai-gateway/`**: `docs/ai-governance/`. Existing pages MOVE under the new root (with redirect stubs left behind, NOT duplicated); cross-links restored both directions.

### v1 shape (locked by @master_orchestrator on @ai_gateway_alexis_2's outline)

1. **No dedicated `routing-policies` admin page in v1.** The default-policy-required constraint (Sergey's `49f81be4f` flag) folds into `overview.mdx` Prerequisites + `cli-debug.mdx` 409-catalog + main quickstarts. Dedicated admin page becomes a v2 candidate if the constraint surface grows.
2. **Promote/move with redirect stubs**, not duplicate. Single source of truth at the new path; old paths return a Mintlify redirect so existing inbound links + SEO survive.
3. **Mermaid first** for architecture diagrams, SVG fallback only if Mintlify renderer fights it.
4. **`claude-cowork` source moves too** for consistency with the rest of the ingestion-sources fleet.

### Page outline — 12 pages flat under `docs/ai-governance/`

| File | Owns | Screenshots | Key cross-links |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overview.mdx` | Landing — personas, feature map, **Admin prerequisites callout (default routing policy required)** per Sergey `49f81be4f` | `governance-hero`, `p1-personal-chrome`, governance-stack diagram | ↔ `ai-gateway/overview`, ← `introduction.mdx` |
| `compliance-architecture.mdx` | End-to-end fold + retention + OCSF (promoted from `ai-gateway/governance/`) | compliance-flow + fold-pipeline diagrams, `ocsf-export-curl` | → `control-plane`, `ai-gateway/audit`, `ai-gateway/observability` |
| `ingestion-sources/index.mdx` | Hub — what an IngestionSource is, supported types, lifecycle (promoted, refreshed per unified-substrate framing) | `sources-list`, `source-detail`, `source-create-drawer` | → 6 per-source pages, `ai-gateway/observability` |
| `ingestion-sources/{otel-generic,workato,s3-custom,copilot-studio,openai-compliance,claude-compliance,claude-cowork}.mdx` | Per-source: configure + verify + troubleshoot (all promoted; `claude-cowork` included for fleet consistency) | 1 configure-drawer shot per source | → `index.mdx`, respective `ai-gateway/providers/*` where relevant |
| `anomaly-rules.mdx` | Rule shapes, CRUD, fold pipeline (promoted) | `rules-list`, `create-drawer`, `anomaly-fold-output` terminal | → `compliance-architecture`, `ingestion-sources/index`, `ai-gateway/budgets` |
| `cli-debug.mdx` | CLI workflow — `budget-status`, fold inspect, OCSF probe, **+ `langwatch login` 409 error catalog** (Sergey's `49f81be4f` flag) | `cli-budget-status`, `cli-anomaly-fold`, **`cli-login-409` (NEW)** | → `ai-gateway/cli/overview`, `overview.mdx#admin-prerequisites` |
| `control-plane.mdx` | Next.js control plane ↔ Go data plane ↔ CH fold (promoted) | control-plane + activity-monitor diagrams | → `ai-gateway/overview`, `self-hosting/*`, `compliance-architecture` |

### Screenshot asset map — 23 assets under `docs/images/ai-governance/<bucket>/`

Bucket layout:
- `personas/` (2 shots) · `admin/` (3) · `drawers/` (2) · `sources/` (6) · `flows/` (2) · `cli/` (3 incl. NEW `cli-login-409`) · `architecture/` (5 — mermaid inline first, SVG fallback if Mintlify struggles)

Convention: docs-rendered + reusable in the PR description via raw GitHub URLs (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langwatch/langwatch/<branch>/docs/images/ai-governance/<bucket>/<state>.png`). iter32-iter33 dogfood evidence stays at `dev/dogfood-screenshots/iter32-iter33/` — separate purpose (review-time evidence vs customer-facing docs).

### Cross-link contract — inbound + reciprocal

| Entry point | Add | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/introduction.mdx` | Peer card "AI Governance" alongside "AI Gateway" | Users entering from compliance / security framing land on the right top-level |
| `docs/integration/quick-start.mdx` | Final-step pointer "Need governance / audit?" | Quickstart graduation path |
| `docs/ai-gateway/overview` | Callout "Need org-wide governance, audit, anomaly detection?" | Reciprocal from gateway readers |
| `docs/ai-gateway/budgets` | Link → `anomaly-rules` | Spend-spike complement |
| `docs/ai-gateway/audit` | Link → `compliance-architecture` | OCSF export discoverability |
| `docs/ai-gateway/cli/overview` | Link → `cli-debug` | CLI users find the governance subcommands |
| `docs/observability/overview` | SIEM anchor → `ocsf-export` (folded into `compliance-architecture`) | Unified-substrate users |

### Code-fix-tied-to-docs flags (folded as @ai_gateway_sergey_2 surfaces them)

Sergey's CodeRabbit triage calls out concrete code fixes where user-visible behavior needs explicit docs coverage. These get folded here as they ship so Alexis pulls them into the right page:

- **409 `no_default_routing_policy` error case (`49f81be4f`, lane-S)** — `langwatch login --device` + `issuePersonal` tRPC now return 409 with `{error: "no_default_routing_policy"}` when the caller relied on default-policy resolution and the org has no default policy. **Docs landing point**:
  - `docs/ai-governance/cli-debug.mdx` — full 409 entry in the error catalog with the actionable next step ("ask your admin to publish a default routing policy via /settings/routing-policies"). New screenshot `cli/cli-login-409.png`.
  - `docs/ai-governance/overview.mdx` — Prerequisites callout: "a default routing policy is required before users can sign in via the CLI."
  - Main quickstarts (`integration/quick-start.mdx` if it covers `langwatch login`) — same note inline.

### Phase 6 atomic-task Gantt — AI Governance docs (lane-B owns; lane-A folds into PR narrative)

| Step | Description | Owner | Critical path |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 ✅ | Scaffolded `docs/ai-governance/{,ingestion-sources}` + `docs/images/ai-governance/{personas,admin,drawers,sources,flows,cli,architecture}/` + `docs.json` `AI Governance` anchor (icon `shield-check`, between AI Gateway and Self Hosting; 5 groups: Get Started, Sources, Detection, Compliance & Architecture, Operations; 12 page slugs wired) | 🅑 (`a4db4f714`) | ✓ |

## §Screenshots — centralized persona × flow grid

> **Single canonical visual evidence surface** (per rchaves reset 2026-05-04). The PR doc body holds zero inline `![…](…)` image references — every screenshot referenced anywhere in this PR description lives in the grid below, and every flow narrative cross-links to a grid cell by coordinate.
>
> **Reorg state**:
> - **Pass 1 ✅** (`1eb0a0acb` 2026-05-04): all scattered inline embeds throughout the PR doc body deleted; engineering narrative preserved as prose-only with grid-cell cross-links.
> - **Pass 2 ⏳**: Lane-B running Playwright dogfood pass against the live stack (Docker recovered); new captures landing under canonical `docs/images/ai-governance/persona-x-flow/<persona>/<flow>/<screen>.png`. Grid cells flip from TBD → populated as captures land.
> - **Pass 3 ⏳**: Lane-A converts ASCII wireframes (Phase 7 §Architecture spine + per-phase ASCII boxes) to "design-time placeholders" with cross-links to the corresponding populated grid cells. Holds until pass 2 is complete so cross-links resolve to real cells, not TBDs.

### Gateway-flow captures (Persona-4 admin)

The persona × flow grid above is governance-centric. Gateway-flow captures (Virtual Keys / Budgets / Providers / Usage / Audit log) live here as a sibling block — same persona-x-flow root, separate sub-table since the columns don't map cleanly to governance flows:

| Gateway surface | Capture |
|---|---|
| Virtual Keys list | ✅ `admin/virtual-keys/01-list.png` |
| Virtual Key detail | ✅ `admin/virtual-keys/02-detail.png` |
| Virtual Key create drawer | ✅ `admin/virtual-keys/03-create-drawer.png` (provider fallback chain + inline validation) |
| Virtual Key edit drawer | ✅ `admin/virtual-keys/04-edit-drawer.png` (populated edit fields + provider chain reorder UI) |
| Budgets list | ✅ `admin/budgets/01-list.png` |
| Budget detail | ✅ `admin/budgets/02-detail.png` |
| Budget detail (live data) | ✅ `admin/budgets/03-live-data.png` (sergey-p3-member personal budget @ live spend; **surfaces row L micro-cent rounding bug**) |
| Providers list | ✅ `admin/providers/01-list.png` |
| Gateway usage | ✅ `admin/usage/01-gateway-usage.png` |
| Gateway usage (live data) | ✅ `admin/usage/02-live-data.png` (same project as budget; **surfaces row M empty-despite-ledger-rows bug**) |
| Audit log | ✅ `admin/audit-log/01-list.png` |

**Asset libraries** — all NEW captures land under the centralized persona × flow scheme `docs/images/ai-governance/persona-x-flow/<persona>/<flow>/<screen>.png` (Lane-B 2026-05-04 reset). Existing libraries below are preserved as historical evidence + will be migrated cell-by-cell as the new captures land:
- `docs/images/ai-governance/persona-x-flow/{dev,admin,finance}/{portal,sessions,admin-policy,ingestion,gateway-usage,cli-handoff}/*.png` — **canonical destination** for the post-2026-05-04 reorg pass
- `docs/images/ai-governance/portal/` — 9 PNGs from Phase 7 B10 dogfood (will migrate to `persona-x-flow/dev/portal/`)
- `docs/images/ai-governance/enterprise-gating/` — 5 PNGs from Phase 5 browser-QA pass (will migrate to `persona-x-flow/admin/admin-policy/`)
- `docs/images/ai-governance/personas/` — persona-aware-chrome shots (will migrate)
- `docs/images/ai-governance/gateway-flows/` — 4 PNGs from Alexis's `c548ab57f` capture batch (will migrate to `persona-x-flow/admin/gateway-usage/`)
- `docs/images/ai-governance/sessions/` — Phase 8 capture target (4 PNGs planned; will land directly under `persona-x-flow/dev/sessions/`)
- `docs/images/ai-governance/no-spy-mode/` — Phase 9 capture target (3 PNGs planned; will land directly under `persona-x-flow/admin/admin-policy/`)
- `docs/images/ai-governance/puller-framework/` — Phase 10 capture target (4 PNGs planned; will land directly under `persona-x-flow/admin/ingestion/`)

**Known route gaps** (surfaced during Alexis's `c548ab57f` gateway capture pass; tracked here as ground-truth for the reorg):
- **`/gateway/audit` — REMOVED (intentional)**. Sergey's earlier consolidation work merged the gateway-scoped audit log into the platform-wide `/settings/audit-log`. PR-doc captions referencing "gateway audit log viewer" are STALE — replace with `/settings/audit-log` cross-links during the reorg pass. (Confirmed Sergey channel post 2026-05-03.)
- **`/gateway/usage` — Vite import-analysis 500 (NOT a routing bug) — RESOLVED in `40c7a4bbc`**. Initial diagnosis ("missing route registration") was wrong. Lane-B traced the actual root cause: `vite.config.ts` was missing the `@ee` path alias, so when `routes.tsx` imported `@ee/governance/dashboard/pages/ingestion-sources` (added in Alexis's `515b4f4c0` Phase 4a-3 UI relocation), Vite's import-analysis pass blew up with `[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import '@ee/governance/...'`. The Vite HMR error overlay then masked **every** route in the app — `/gateway/usage`'s "404" was the overlay, not a missing page. Fix in `40c7a4bbc`: one-line addition `'@ee': path.resolve(__dirname, './ee')` to `vite.config.ts` resolve.alias.
- **Workers process: silent reactor crashloop since `ee/` relocation — RESOLVED in `40c7a4bbc`**. Same alias gap, different config: `tsconfig.workers.json` overrides the root `tsconfig.json` `paths` and was missing `@ee/*`. When `gatewayBudgetSync.reactor`, `governanceKpisSync.reactor`, `governanceOcsfEventsSync.reactor` got relocated to `langwatch/ee/governance/reactors/` earlier in this PR, the workers process started failing to load them with `Cannot find module '@ee/governance/reactors/gatewayBudgetSync.reactor'` and crashlooped silently. The Phase 7 trace→budget fold + governance KPI projections + OCSF event projections were **DOA in the workers process** since the relocation, even though unit/integration tests passed (those don't use `tsconfig.workers.json`). Fix in `40c7a4bbc`: one-line addition `"@ee/*": ["./ee/*"]` to `tsconfig.workers.json` `compilerOptions.paths`. Sergey's smoke run + trace-id capture pending — will fold §Smoke evidence row when it lands.

**Process learning** (folded into PR retrospective): when introducing a new path-alias prefix, audit ALL `tsconfig*.json` overrides + `vite.config.ts` resolve.alias + `vitest.config.ts` resolve.alias **+ every workspace package's own `tsconfig.json`** in the same change. The `@ee/*` alias was missed in three places across this PR — corrected as the failures surfaced: (1) `tsconfig.workers.json` (`40c7a4bbc`); (2) `vite.config.ts` (`40c7a4bbc`); (3) `langwatch/packages/es-migration/tsconfig.json` (`96a4b1041`). The reason these slipped: none of them are exercised by `pnpm typecheck` or `pnpm test:*` — they're loaded only by their respective runtime entry-points (workers process, Vite dev server, es-migration package binary). Future open-core split work should use a comprehensive "alias parity grep": `rg -l '"paths"|resolve.alias' --type json --type ts` enumerates every config file that needs the new prefix; this PR's experience says **assume the grep set is incomplete** until each runtime entry-point has been exercised in CI at least once.

**Reorg plan** (Lane-A, post-asset-library):
1. Lane-B captures all TBD cells in the grid above + Phase 8/9/10 dogfood shots
2. Lane-A consolidates this section into a flat persona-by-persona walkthrough (Persona-4 admin walkthrough top-to-bottom; Persona-3 member-with-CLI walkthrough top-to-bottom; etc.)
3. Existing scattered screenshot placements throughout the PR doc → replaced with cross-links into this central section
4. ASCII wireframes (Phase 7 §Architecture spine + ASCII wireframes) → marked as "design-time placeholders" with cross-links to the corresponding real-screenshot cells

**Until reorg lands**, screenshots remain at their current scattered placements — the grid above is the canonical TODO list for Lane-B captures + Lane-A consolidation.

## UI flows + spec ↔ screenshot mapping

> **All screenshots live in §Screenshots above** — single canonical persona × flow grid. This section preserves the engineering narrative + the spec-↔-screenshot mapping table that ties each captured frame back to the BDD scenario it proves. Image references throughout this section are deliberately **prose-only** and cross-link into the grid by cell coordinate (persona / flow); no inline `![…]()` embeds in the body of the PR description outside the central grid, per @rchaves's "screenshots all spread out" reset 2026-05-04.

### Flow narratives (engineering claims, screenshot evidence in the central grid)

The customer journey post-`33a8cf6d0` (full receiver rewire) was captured frame-by-frame during the iter22-iter33 dogfood passes. Each flow below maps a spec scenario to a grid cell:

- **`/governance` admin overview** (org-scoped, NOT project-gated; iter27 update replaces iter22 $0/0 synthetic shot — KPI strip + Recent anomalies now flow from real `recorded_spans` + `log_records` + `governance_kpis` data) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Compliance posture**.
- **`/settings/governance/ingestion-sources` list** (fleet management; per-source last-event timestamps, status, Rotate-secret affordance with 24h grace window) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Ingestion sources**.
- **Add ingestion source composer drawer** (right-edge Drawer per universal create/edit pattern, `746951769`; retention-class dropdown with three options gated by org plan ceiling — Operational/Compliance/Long-form audit; **NO Project field** — hidden Governance Project is internal routing only, per `master_orchestrator` + `rchaves` directive 2026-04-27) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Ingestion sources** (composer state).
- **WorkspaceSwitcher pre-helper** (baseline: no IngestionSource exists, no hidden Governance Project minted — helper is lazy, feature-flag activation alone does not create one) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Empty state**.
- **SecretModal post-create** (one-time bearer reveal + curl example; "OTLP **ingestion** endpoint" framing — not "audit-event endpoint" — locked by `7cf097a22` revert; "different auth, **same trace store**" copy is the unified-substrate framing) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Ingestion sources** (post-create state).
- **WorkspaceSwitcher post-helper** — `ensureHiddenGovernanceProject` minted a real `Project.kind = "internal_governance"` row through Sergey's lazy-ensure helper (`94426716e`); WorkspaceSwitcher dropdown is unchanged. Layer-1 filter at `PrismaOrganizationRepository.getAllForUser` hides the routing artifact from every user-visible Project surface — proven end-to-end through real DB state, not synthetic test data. **This is the hidden-Governance-Project non-leak invariant operating in live UI.** → grid cell **Persona-4 / Compliance posture** (post-bootstrap state).
- **Anomaly rules list** (`/settings/governance/anomaly-rules`; Critical/Warning/Info severity sections; cross-linked from governance overview when rule fires) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Anomaly rules**.
- **AnomalyRule composer drawer** (`size=lg`; Name + Severity + Description + Rule type + Scope + Threshold JSON; v1 ships `spend_spike` + log-only dispatch; `rate_limit` / `after_hours` / Slack / PagerDuty / webhook / email destinations explicitly **preview** in composer copy — config persists, evaluation/dispatch is follow-up; honest framing per @rchaves "no mocks in UI" directive) → grid cell **Persona-4 / Anomaly rules** (composer state).
- **Persona-aware chrome** — iter29 cross-lane fix (`a935d707e` + `b311d1ca5` + `385c95e89` + `043726430`) wired the chrome (sidebar + selectors) to match the persona-aware home routing claim from 1.5b-viii (`e40ee0045`). Persona-1 (`/me`): one chip header + PersonalSidebar (My Usage + Settings only) + NO ProjectSelector + NO redundant in-page chip. Persona-4 (admin home): full LLMOps sidebar + Govern (Preview) + Gateway (Beta) sections both visible. Persona-4 (`/governance`): org chip + "Organization-scoped" banner + Govern active + setup checklist visible **without any IngestionSource yet** (chicken-and-egg gate fix VALIDATED). → grid cells **Persona-1 / `/me` portal**, **Persona-4 / Onboarding**, **Persona-4 / Compliance posture**.
- **iter32-iter33 chrome walks** (19 PNGs at `dev/dogfood-screenshots/iter32-iter33/`) closed papercuts E (`.env.example` two-flag default), F (`9e373c284` router-layer RBAC enforcement) + `d311c2f70` seed-gap follow-up, G (`c991006c3` + `071a416f8` 4-layer race close on persona-1 `/me` home redirect). → grid cells **Persona-1 / `/me` portal**, **Persona-3 / Error state**, **Persona-4 / Onboarding**.

### Spec ↔ screenshot mapping (consolidated)

Single canonical mapping — every screenshot in the §Screenshots grid traces back to a BDD scenario here. The list is the audit trail; the grid above is the visual evidence:

| Grid cell | Proves | Spec scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Persona-4 / Compliance posture | Org-scoped admin surface renders chrome + KPI strip + IngestionSources panel against live PG | `ui-contract.feature` "single governance surface" |
| Persona-4 / Ingestion sources (list) | Fleet management surface + per-source action affordances + Rotate secret 24h grace | `ingestion-sources.feature` list + rotation |
| Persona-4 / Ingestion sources (composer) | Retention-class dropdown with canonical enum values; NO project picker (Governance Project is internal routing only) | `ui-contract.feature` "composer offers retention class" + "no project picker" |
| Persona-4 / Empty state | Baseline — no Gov Project exists; helper is lazy | `architecture-invariants.feature` lazy-ensure semantics |
| Persona-4 / Ingestion sources (post-create) | Unified-substrate copy ("OTLP ingestion endpoint" + "different auth, same trace store"), not parallel-audit-events framing | `ui-contract.feature` SecretModal copy + commit `7cf097a22` revert |
| Persona-4 / Compliance posture (post-bootstrap) | Hidden Governance Project never leaks into user-visible Project surfaces, **proven against real DB state** | `architecture-invariants.feature` "hidden Gov Project never appears in user-visible Project surfaces" + Layer-1 filter at `getAllForUser` |
| Persona-4 / Anomaly rules (list) | AnomalyRule + AnomalyAlert read paths render against real PG state | `architecture-invariants.feature` AnomalyRule lifecycle |
| Persona-4 / Anomaly rules (composer) | Composer offers retention-class + scope + threshold; Preview-rule-type framing matches spec contract | `ui-contract.feature` composer scenarios |
| Persona-1 / `/me` portal | Persona-1 chrome — ONE chip in header, PersonalSidebar (My Usage + Settings only), NO ProjectSelector, NO redundant in-page chip | `persona-aware-chrome.feature` Persona-1 chrome scenarios |
| Persona-4 / Onboarding | Admin lands on project context with full LLMOps sidebar + Govern (Preview) + Gateway (Beta) both visible (admin role + 2 FFs on) | `persona-aware-chrome.feature` Persona-4 chrome scenarios |
| Persona-3 / Error state | MEMBER hitting `/governance` directly — "Access Restricted" page guard fires; sidebar correctly hides Govern entry; tRPC also returns 401 (defense-in-depth) | RBAC test + `persona-aware-chrome.feature` |

**Regression-safety invariant locked**: Persona-3 (LLMOps majority — ~90% of users today, no AI gateway) sees ZERO chrome change. `DashboardLayout` is untouched for `project_only` persona. Codified in `persona-aware-chrome.feature` as the FIRST scenario in the file.

> **Note on URL hosts**: earlier drafts of this section embedded image URLs directly via `i.img402.dev` (7-day free CDN; URLs from iter22-iter29 captures are now expired) and `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../dev/dogfood-screenshots/iter32-iter33/...` (these survive branch state). All inline embeds removed in the 2026-05-04 reorg pass; the canonical visual evidence now lives ONLY in §Screenshots above, with new captures landing under `docs/images/ai-governance/persona-x-flow/<persona>/<flow>/<screen>.png` per Lane-B's centralized capture path scheme.

## License model — open-core split (Apache 2.0 + `ee/`)

> Per rchaves directive 2026-04-28: LangWatch is moving from BSL to **Apache 2.0** for the open-core surface, with enterprise modules under `langwatch/ee/` carrying a separate Enterprise license. This section captures the cross-lane consensus on **what stays open** vs **what moves to `ee/`** for the governance pillar this PR introduces. Cross-lane sources: lane-S (Sergey) + lane-B (Alexis at `.monitor-logs/lane-b-license-split-input.md`) + lane-A (Andre, this fold).

### Decision framework

A feature ships **Apache 2.0** when *any* of: (1) solo developer / small team gets standalone value without enterprise admin features; (2) trivial to rebuild (1–2 weeks for a determined competitor); (3) GTM viral surface devs install + tell colleagues about.

A feature ships **`ee/`** when *any* of: (1) compliance / governance is the customer-stated value (SOC2 / HIPAA / EU AI Act framework reports, retention class, SIEM export); (2) cross-source / cross-team / cross-org scale is the value (multi-source ingestion fleet, anomaly detection fleet, org-wide rollups); (3) high enterprise-glue cost (SCIM provisioning, revocation automation against vendor admin APIs); (4) lawsuit risk if a competitor copies it verbatim into their commercial product.

### Apache 2.0 floor — the trial wedge

A self-hosted free-tier user gets:

- One organization, one Personal Team, one Personal Project
- One personal Virtual Key with default RoutingPolicy
- **One IngestionSource of type `otel_generic`** with retention `thirty_days`
- `/governance` dashboard with **basic per-source widgets** (single-source spend, single-source events; no anomaly count, no cross-source rollup, no compliance posture)
- `langwatch` CLI with login + claude/codex/cursor/gemini/shell wrappers
- `/api/otel/v1/traces` SDK ingest unchanged

**The open-source demo loop closes end-to-end on Apache 2.0**: install → `langwatch login` → `langwatch claude` → `/governance` shows the basic OTel ingest. Maps to the GitLab CE / Sentry OSS / Grafana OSS pattern.

### What stays Apache 2.0 (open core)

| Feature | Where | Why open |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway proxy core (Bifrost-embedded routing/policy/budget) | `services/aigateway/` + `langwatch/src/server/governance/routing-policies/` | Trivial to rebuild; viral surface |
| Personal Virtual Keys + per-(user/team/project) GatewayBudget primitives | `langwatch/src/server/api/routers/virtualKeys.ts` | Per-dev API key minting; small team value |
| `langwatch` CLI binary + `login`/`claude`/`codex`/`cursor`/`gemini`/`shell` commands | `typescript-sdk/src/cli/` | Personal IDE-keys experience; the GTM viral surface |
| OTel SDK ingest via `/api/otel/v1/traces` + `/api/otel/v1/logs` | `langwatch/src/server/routes/otel.ts` | Existing apache2-equivalent; the open trace pipeline |
| **Governance ingest receivers** (`/api/ingest/{otel,webhook}/:sourceId`) — transport only | `langwatch/src/server/routes/ingest/ingestionRoutes.ts` | The trial wedge needs the receiver itself open. Service layer gates the *features* (multi-source, retention tiers); the HTTP path is just transport. |
| **`ensureHiddenGovernanceProject` helper** | `langwatch/src/server/governance/governanceProject.service.ts` | Substrate primitive called by the apache2 receiver. No-op for orgs with zero IngestionSources. |
| **`IngestionSourceService` with service-layer gate** | `langwatch/src/server/governance/activity-monitor/ingestionSource.service.ts` | Service stays apache2; `createSource` enforces: non-enterprise orgs limited to **1 source max**, **`sourceType = otel_generic` only**, **`retentionClass = thirty_days` only**. Single 403 boundary for all gating. |
| **`ActivityMonitorService` — basic per-source widgets** (`summary`, `ingestionSourcesHealth`, `eventsForSource`) | `langwatch/src/server/governance/activity-monitor/activityMonitor.service.ts` | Cross-source aggregations + anomaly rollups split to `activityMonitor.enterprise.service.ts` in `ee/`; basic surface stays apache2. |
| `setupState.service.ts` (persona-detection probe) | `langwatch/src/server/governance/setupState.service.ts` | Substrate primitive; drives free-tier nav promotion |
| Personal "My Usage" dashboard | `langwatch/src/components/dashboard/PersonalUsage*` | Solo-dev value |
| Single-project trace viewer + log detail pane | `langwatch/src/components/messages/` | Existing core LangWatch |
| `/governance` dashboard shell + basic-only widgets | `langwatch/src/components/governance/GovernanceDashboard.tsx` | Trial wedge surface |
| Schema: `Project.kind`, `IngestionSource.retentionClass`, `IngestionSource` model itself, `AnomalyRule`/`AnomalyAlert` models | `langwatch/prisma/schema.prisma` | Schemas are no-op when no rows exist. Service-layer gate, not Prisma multi-schema. |
| Shared OTLP body parser (`parseOtlpBody.ts`) | `langwatch/src/server/otel/parseOtlpBody.ts` | Used by both `/v1/traces` and governance receivers; single source of truth |
| `event_log` + projection pipeline (PR #3351) | `langwatch/src/server/event-sourcing/` | Existing core durability foundation |
| Layer-1 `Project.kind` filter at `getAllForUser` | `langwatch/src/server/app-layer/organizations/repositories/organization.prisma.repository.ts` | Filter is a no-op when no `internal_governance` projects exist; defensive correctness |
| SPAN_ATTR_MAPPINGS hoisting `langwatch.origin.*` + `langwatch.governance.*` keys | `langwatch/src/server/event-sourcing/pipelines/trace-processing/projections/traceSummary.foldProjection.ts` | Forward-compatible no-op when no governance traffic flows |

### What moves to `ee/governance/` (Enterprise license)

Mirroring the existing `langwatch/ee/{admin,billing,licensing,managed-providers,saas}/` layout. Net relocation: ~6 backend files + their tests + ~8 UI surfaces.

| Feature | From | To | Why enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-source-type expansion (`workato` / `claude_cowork` / `s3_custom` / `copilot_studio` / `openai_compliance` / `claude_compliance`) — gated at `IngestionSourceService.createSource` | `langwatch/src/server/governance/activity-monitor/` | `langwatch/ee/governance/ingestion/` | Multi-source fleet is the enterprise pricing axis |
| `ActivityMonitorService` cross-source aggregations + anomaly rollups | (split from existing) | `langwatch/ee/governance/activity-monitor/activityMonitor.enterprise.service.ts` | Cross-source rollup = enterprise UX |
| `AnomalyRuleService` + `anomalyRule.router` (composer + reactor + dispatch) | `langwatch/src/server/governance/anomaly/` | `langwatch/ee/governance/anomaly/` | Enterprise muscle |
| Anomaly dispatch destinations (Slack / PagerDuty / email / webhook) | (planned C3) | `langwatch/ee/governance/anomaly/dispatch/` | Pure enterprise glue |
| `governance_kpis` + `governance_ocsf_events` fold projections (3b/3d) | (planned) | `langwatch/ee/governance/folds/` | Enterprise read-side primitives |
| Per-origin retention TTL hook (3c) — `one_year` + `seven_years` tiers | (planned) | `langwatch/ee/governance/retention/` | Compliance-driven retention |
| OCSF v1.1 read API + thin push wrapper (3f) | (planned) | `langwatch/ee/governance/ocsf-export/` | "Pull governance into your SIEM" pricing axis |
| Compliance posture report generator (SOC2 / ISO27001 / EU AI Act framework cross-mapping) | (planned) | `langwatch/ee/governance/compliance/` | Compliance reporting = enterprise ask |
| SCIM provisioning + per-user Anthropic key flow | `langwatch/ee/admin/scim/` | unchanged | Already in ee/ |
| Revocation automation (vendor admin APIs) | (planned C3+) | `langwatch/ee/governance/revocation/` | Enterprise glue, lawsuit-attractive |
| Governance dashboard advanced widgets (multi-source rollup, anomaly count, compliance dial) | (split from existing) | `langwatch/ee/governance/dashboard/` | Cross-source rollup view = enterprise UX |
| AnomalyRule composer + alert-destinations + compliance-posture + ocsf-export pages | `langwatch/src/components/governance/` | `langwatch/ee/governance/dashboard/` | Enterprise UI surfaces |
| All 8 BDD specs `specs/ai-gateway/governance/*.feature` | unchanged path | unchanged | Specs document the contract; relocation cosmetic — keep where reviewers expect them |

### UI gating pattern — 3 tiers (Alexis)

> Per rchaves directive: "*always just grayed out on the frontend, allowing them to see it exists but being blocked.*"

**Tier UI-1 — visible-but-locked surface (default)**: render the page chrome, table, composer button, empty state. Every interactive control disabled with an "Enterprise" inline badge. Persistent overlay banner: *"This is an Enterprise feature. You can preview it here. Contact sales to unlock."* Component: new `<EnterpriseLockedSurface tier="anomaly-rules">` wrapper, ~1-line per page.

**Tier UI-2 — visible-with-disabled-options (mixed surfaces)**: surfaces where some options are apache2 and some are ee/. Example: IngestionSource composer's Source Type dropdown — `otel_generic` selectable, the other 6 grayed-out with `(Enterprise)` badge + tooltip. Extension to existing Chakra `<Select>` adapter, ~30 LOC.

**Tier UI-3 — hidden (rare)**: low-level ops controls that depend on ee-only data plane and would confuse free-tier users (retention TTL knob, OCSF schema selector, cache rules). Conditional render behind `useActivePlan().isEnterprise`. Use sparingly — UI-1 converts; UI-3 doesn't.

### 18-surface UI license inventory (Alexis)

| URL | License | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/me` (personal usage) | apache2 | — | Solo-dev wedge |
| `/me/settings` (PAT + budget readonly + devices) | apache2 | — | Free-tier essential |
| `/[project]/settings/virtual-keys` | apache2 | — | Per-project VK CRUD |
| `/[project]/settings/budgets` | apache2 | — | Per-project / per-VK / per-principal budgets |
| `/[project]/settings/audit` | apache2 | — | Per-project audit log |
| `/settings/routing-policies` | apache2 | — | Org-default + team-overrides |
| `/settings/model-providers` | apache2 | — | Org/Team/Project provider scoping |
| `/settings/usage` (subscription) | apache2 | — | Upgrade-CTA deep-link target |
| `/governance` (top-level dashboard) | mixed | UI-1 base + UI-2 widgets | Apache2 shell + basic widgets; ee/-gated multi-source rollups + anomaly count |
| `/settings/governance/setup` | apache2 | — | Free shows OTel + Personal-VK steps; ee/ steps behind "More with Enterprise →" disclosure |
| `/settings/governance/ingestion-sources` | mixed | UI-2 on composer | List apache2 (1 source); composer source-type dropdown UI-2 |
| `/settings/governance/anomaly-rules` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | Visible+locked. Composer schema visible to free user; create disabled |
| `/settings/governance/alert-destinations` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | Same |
| `/settings/governance/compliance-posture` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | Framework matrix grayed out |
| `/settings/governance/ocsf-export` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | OCSF schema preview visible; activation locked |
| `/settings/governance/retention-policies` | ee/ | UI-3 hidden | Free-tier retention is fixed at `thirty_days`; the knob doesn't exist |
| `/settings/governance/cache-rules` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | iter38/iter41 shipped — gate retroactively |
| `/settings/groups` + `/settings/roles` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | Existing early-return — refactor candidate |
| `/settings/scim` | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | When personal-key SCIM ships |
| `/settings/audit` (org-wide) | ee/ | UI-1 wrap | Per-project audit apache2; org-wide ee/ |

### CLI gating

The `langwatch` CLI binary stays apache2 (single binary; viral install surface). Subcommands that hit enterprise-only endpoints (`langwatch ingest list/health/tail` for ee/-only sources, `langwatch governance status` showing enterprise widgets) get **402 Payment Required** envelopes from `/api/auth/cli/governance/*` for non-enterprise orgs:

```json
{
  "error": "enterprise_required",
  "feature": "governance.multi_source_ingestion",
  "upsell_url": "https://app.langwatch.ai/settings/usage"
}
```

The CLI prints a friendly upsell message + the URL. No CLI binary split.

### License-flip transition

Two votes deferred to rchaves resolution (tagged at end of PM round-up below):

- **Vote D**: Personal-key SSO (SCIM auto-provisioning of personal teams + policies) — apache2 vs `ee/`? Lane-A and lane-B lean apache2; precedent (GitLab CE) puts SAML in CE and SCIM/group-sync in EE. Defer to rchaves's call.
- **Vote F**: BSL → Apache 2.0 license-flip TIMING — same PR as governance ee/ relocation, or separate prep PR landing first? Defer to rchaves's call (legal/strategy).

### Phase 1A — Personal IDE keys (Direction 1, P0) — APACHE 2.0

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 🅢 | `Project.isPersonal` + `Team.isPersonal` schema |
| ✅ | 🅢 | `VirtualKey.ownerType` polymorphic owner pattern |
| ✅ | 🅢 | Auto-create personal Team on user org-join |

| ✅ | 🅐 | Per-CLI-tool docs (claude-code/codex/cursor/gemini-cli with wrapper sections) |
| ⏳ | 🅐 | Single-binary installers (`curl ... \| sh` / Homebrew tap / PowerShell `iex`) |

### Phase 1B — Polish (Direction 1, P1) — APACHE 2.0

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 🅐 | Persona fork on `/ai-gateway/quickstart` (developer vs admin) |
| ✅ | 🅑 | Fresh-admin reachability fix (`99dbc77e8`) |
| ✅ | 🅑 | GovernanceLayout chrome (org chip + "Organization-scoped" indicator) |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **CLI token revoke on deactivation** (reframed from "Token refresh background job"; the `/api/auth/cli/refresh` endpoint already rotates correctly with Redis TTL handling auto-cleanup, so the real defense-in-depth gap was revoke-all-CLI-tokens on user deactivation) — `4d83d4ff1`: new `CliTokenRevocationService` with per-user `lwcli:user:<userId>:tokens` Redis SET index (mirrors `revokeAllSessionsForUser`); `auth-cli.ts` `/exchange` + `/refresh` SADD newly-minted tokens into the index with PEXPIRE to refresh-token TTL; `userService.deactivate` calls `revokeForUser` after BetterAuth session revocation, wired through every deactivation path (tRPC + SCIM webhook + SCIM provisioning sync). Per-key DELs for cluster safety (multi-key DELs CROSSSLOT-reject — same constraint as `auth-cli.ts:347`). 4 integration tests green. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **Per-user budget enforcement (cascading strictest-wins)** — `4d83d4ff1`: `GatewayBudgetService.create` now rejects PRINCIPAL scope when the named user isn't an `OrganizationUser` of the budget's org → fast `BAD_REQUEST` instead of silent FK-mismatch no-op. 5 cascade integration tests pin: PRINCIPAL persists with right `scopeType` + `principalUserId`, cross-org guard rejects outsider, cascade BLOCKs when PRINCIPAL is the only over-limit scope, `principalUserId: undefined` makes cascade ignore alice's principal budget, project-blocker case proves cascade is content-addressable. New BDD specs: `specs/ai-gateway/budgets-principal-cascade.feature` + `specs/ai-gateway/cli-token-revoke-on-deactivation.feature`. |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **1B-followup-1: PRINCIPAL admin UI in `BudgetCreateDrawer`** — `717745384` (+75/-13). PRINCIPAL option in scope picker; conditional org-member picker (`api.organization.getAllOrganizationMembers`, query-gated on `scope === PRINCIPAL`); `principalUserId` wired through to `api.gatewayBudgets.create`; cross-org `BAD_REQUEST` + missing-member errors surface inline as `Field.ErrorText` (not toast — user fixes without dismiss); dropped the stale "principal scope is configured from its own detail page" helper text. Typecheck clean. Cross-org guard from Sergey's `4d83d4ff1` surfaces cleanly inline when an outsider `userId` is passed. |
| 📋 | 🅢 | **1B-followup-2: Admin "revoke this user's CLI sessions" affordance** — Phase 5 polish row. Out of scope for this PR. |
| ⏳ | 🅑 | Admin user-activity report (cross-team) |

#### Phase 1B.5 — Jane-at-Acme storyboard polish + persona-aware home (NEW per rchaves directive 2026-04-29)

The Jane at Acme 8-screen storyboard from `gateway.md` is the **trial-wedge demo loop** that closes enterprise sales. Most surfaces are already shipped; this slice is polish + the persona-aware `/` redirect + screenshots. **Full storyboard + per-screen audit + persona-home model below in §Personal-Key Journey.**

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| 🚧 | 🅑 | 1.5b-i: Live-data Playwright dogfood + screenshots — Screens 1 / 3 / 5 wireable today; first batch (3 shots) captured against running dev server |
| ⏳ | 🅑 | 1.5b-ii: Screen 2 — single-input email-only `/signin-cli` variant (vs full-provider-list /signin) |
| ⏳ | 🅑 | 1.5b-iii: Screen 4 — "You're in!" ceremony page redesign + close-tab CTA + provider+budget summary |
| ⏳ | 🅑 | 1.5b-iv: Screen 6 — `/me` layout refresh — *scope reduced ~3x post-iter27 audit: layout already production-ready; minor polish only* |
| ⏳ | 🅑 | 1.5b-v: Screen 7 — `/me/settings` polish — *scope reduced ~3x post-iter27 audit: managed-by-your-company chrome already in place; minor polish only* |
| ⏳ | 🅑 | 1.5b-vi: Screen 8 — `BudgetExceededBanner` web-side enrichment to match storyboard tone |
| ✅ | 🅑 | 1.5b-vii: WorkspaceSwitcher v2 — Personal/Team/Project visual + "managed by your company" indicator (already storyboard-shape; verified iter29) |
| ✅ | 🅑 | 1.5b-viii: Persona resolver service + `/` redirect + tRPC router + regression test — `e40ee0045` (12/12 unit tests, BDD spec, regression invariant for LLMOps majority locked) |
| ✅ | 🅑 | 1.5b-ix: BDD spec `persona-home-resolver.feature` (shipped with `e40ee0045`) |
| ✅ | 🅑 | 1.5b-x: Live-data dogfood post-resolver — 3 persona-chrome screenshots uploaded to img402.dev + embedded inline in §UI verification screenshots (persona1-me-personal, persona4-admin-home, persona4-governance) |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **1.5b-xi: Persona-aware chrome rework** — initial 1.5b-viii resolver shipped routing only; iter29 dogfood surfaced chrome was unchanged (two-selector bug, irrelevant LLMOps sidebar on /me). Cross-lane fix: `a935d707e` (PersonalSidebar + DashboardLayout chrome swap + MyLayout shrink + chicken-and-egg gate fix) + `b311d1ca5` (BDD spec FF correction, two-flag shape) + `043726430` (gate consumes `governance:view` permission post-rbac.ts catalog) + 197-LOC `persona-aware-chrome.feature` BDD spec |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **1.5s-rbac: AI Governance RBAC permissions catalog** — `385c95e89` (5 new Resources × actions in `rbac.ts`; ADMIN default-grant; MEMBER + EXTERNAL get nothing; `CustomRolePermissions` JSON column = the production-shape delegation surface) |
| ✅ | 🅢 | 1.5s: `setupState.hasApplicationTraces` flag — `9d2688c84` (consumed by 1.5b-viii via `api.governance.setupState`) |
| ✅ | 🅐+🅢 | 1.5a-cli-1: CLI Screen 4 ceremony — `b8b21bb79` (formatLoginCeremony helper, 15 unit tests) + `32cad11ae` (api.user.cliBootstrap tRPC) + `5c0816bb0` (CliBootstrapService extract + REST adapter) + `d38ba422e` (CLI fold-in via getCliBootstrap, 4 new unit tests). End-to-end rich Screen 4 ceremony (providers + budget) live on this branch. |
| ✅ | 🅐 | 1.5a-cli-2: CLI Screen 8 budget-limit-reached + `langwatch request-increase` (existing — `commands/request-increase.ts` + `utils/governance/budget.ts` `renderBudgetExceeded` + `checkBudget` pre-exec probe + 16 unit tests). *Audit gap caught — was already shipped before Phase 1B.5 fold.* |
| ✅ | 🅐 | 1.5a-docs: Customer-facing docs flip COMPLETE — 4 waves: wave 1 `1e34cd9ef` (`trace-vs-activity-ingestion.mdx` reframed) + wave 2 `f13c33e20` (NEW `compliance-architecture.mdx` + `retention.mdx` + `ocsf-export.mdx`) + wave 3 `5bca796f2` (8 ingestion-source pages reframed) + wave 4 `0b4f4d90e` (`personal-keys.mdx` storyboard refresh with 40-second pitch + `formatLoginCeremony` output + `langwatch request-increase` UX + cross-references to wave-2 pages) |
| ⏳ | 🅐 | 1.5a-marketing: Marketing-page outline for the open-core / personal IDE keys offering — gitignored draft at `.monitor-logs/lane-a-marketing-outline-draft.md` (~250 LOC, 9-section structure: hero / pain / solution / how-it-works / features / compliance / open-core pitch / pricing / footer CTA). Lives in `.monitor-logs/` until rchaves picks the home (probably the langwatch.ai marketing repo). |

### Phase 2A — Multi-source ingestion (Direction 2, P1) — UNIFIED SUBSTRATE (mostly Apache 2.0; multi-source fleet `ee/`)

| | Owner | Task |

| ✅ | 🅢 | Step 3c: Per-origin retention TTL hook — `3156b9e17` (3c-i migration) + `629c50734` (3c-ii write-side) + `8325a5262` (3c-iii cold-storage combine via ttlReconciler) + `cb3702cd2` (3c-iv integration test). Chain closed end-to-end across both install modes. |

### Phase 4 — License relocation + UI gating (rchaves directive 2026-04-28; **un-deferred 2026-05-03**)

> **Vote H OVERRIDDEN per rchaves directive 2026-05-03**: everything in Phase 4 ships in THIS PR except the literal root `LICENSE` file change (4c-3), which is the only follow-up PR scope. 4a relocation + 4b UI gating + 4b-4/5 service-layer 403 + 4b-6 CLI 402 + 4b-7 docs + 4c-1 assertion test + 4c-2 per-file headers + 4c-4 README split + tRPC permission granularization all land here.

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| 🚧 | 🅐 | This PM proposal (license split + Gantt + product roundup) |
| 🚧 | 🌐 | Cross-lane review of license-split + Gantt; pushback / consolidation |
| 🚧 | 🅐 | Fold license-split + Gantt into PR-3524-DESCRIPTION.md (THIS COMMIT) |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **4a-1 + 4a-2** — `160d1a8c8` (73 files moved, zero behavior change, typecheck clean, 34 moved router + service integration tests still pass). Apache-2.0 floor stays in `langwatch/src/`; EE-gated governance code lives under `langwatch/ee/governance/`: `services/` (14 files — ingestion source, anomaly rule, threshold/destination configs, dispatcher, governance project, personal VK/workspace/usage, persona resolver, routing policy, setup state, OCSF events repo + export, spend-spike evaluator, AI tool entry, CLI bootstrap + token revocation, governance KPIs repo + per-service tests); `routers/` (5 + 3 tests — governance, anomalyRules, activityMonitor, ingestionSources, aiTools); `reactors/` (4 + 3 unit tests — gatewayBudgetSync, governanceKpisSync, governanceOcsfEventsSync, alertTrigger). New `@ee/*` path alias in tsconfig.json + tsconfig.tsgo.json + every vitest config. Reactor pipeline registry + root tRPC router updated. **Stayed in `langwatch/src/`** (intentional): 3 governance ClickHouse migrations (00025/00027/00028 — runner path), trace-processing pipeline scaffolding (core, not governance-specific), `api/enterprise.ts` + `api/rbac.ts` (general infrastructure). |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **4a-3** — `515b4f4c0`. 3 governance pages `git mv`'d to `langwatch/ee/governance/dashboard/pages/`: `anomaly-rules.tsx`, `ingestion-sources.tsx`, `ingestion-source-detail.tsx`. `routes.tsx` imports updated to use the `@ee/*` alias; page-internal `~/...` imports unchanged (resolve to `langwatch/src/` shared components like `LoadingScreen`, `SettingsLayout`, `EnterpriseLockedSurface`). **Intentional Apache-2.0-floor exclusions** (NOT moved): `AiToolsPortal` + tiles + `ToolCatalogEditor` + `AiToolEntryDrawer` (Phase 7 floor); `EnterpriseLockedSurface` + `EnterpriseLockedKpi` (general gate primitive consumed by both Apache + EE surfaces); `BudgetCreateDrawer` (mixed Apache base + EE PRINCIPAL — splitting requires a separate refactor; left as-is). |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **4a-tRPC: routingPolicies permission granularization** — `73c39d443` (2 files, +17/-7). New `routingPolicies:view` + `routingPolicies:manage` permissions added to RBAC catalog; `routingPolicies` router fully migrated off `organization:manage`. typecheck clean. Other org-mgmt sites (`roleBinding.ts`, `project.ts`, `governance.resolveHome`) intentionally untouched — those ARE genuine org-management ops, not governance ops. The other governance routers (anomalyRules, activityMonitor, ingestionSources, aiTools, governance) already use granular `governance:*` / `aiTools:*` permissions from prior phases — no further sweep needed. |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **4b-1: `<EnterpriseLockedSurface>` + `<EnterpriseLockedKpi>` components** — `2c3435e64` (5 files, +140/-0). Both consume `useActivePlan().isEnterprise` (hook already in repo at `langwatch/src/hooks/useActivePlan.ts`); skeleton during `isLoading` (no flash); upsell card with `/settings/subscription` CTA on the full-page variant; `EnterpriseLockedKpi` is the compact tile variant exported-not-yet-consumed (lands for use on the governance landing dashboard's enterprise-only KPI tiles when those wire up). |
| ✅ (narrowed) | 🅑 | **4b-2: Wire UI-1 wrap on existing governance surfaces** — `2c3435e64` wired `anomaly-rules.tsx` + `ingestion-sources.tsx` + `ingestion-source-detail.tsx` (each gets a `featureName` + tailored description copy). The other 5 surfaces from the original 4b-2 list (`alert-destinations`, `compliance-posture`, `ocsf-export`, `cache-rules`, `org-wide-audit`) are 📋 deferred — pages don't exist yet; wrapping is a 1-line addition when they ship. `groups`/`roles`/`scim` exist at `/settings/` but were left as out-of-governance-scope-PR per master_orchestrator narrowing. Per master_orchestrator: `tool-catalog` / `governance` landing / `routing-policies` remain Apache-2.0 floor (NOT gated). |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **4b-3: IngestionSource composer source-type / retention dropdown gate** — `26f9a0f67` (+24/-2). Inline `useActivePlan()` filter on `SourceComposerDrawer`: source-type dropdown shows only `otel_generic` (filters from full `SOURCE_TYPE_OPTIONS`) for non-enterprise; retention-class dropdown shows only `thirty_days` (filters from `RETENTION_CLASS_OPTIONS`); per-dropdown helper text points to Enterprise upgrade for the filtered options. Pairs with Sergey's `f8eec569b` service-layer + router 403 — **UI prevents selection, backend rejects bypasses**. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **4b-4: Service-layer up-front plan-assertion at `IngestionSourceService.createSource`** — `f8eec569b`. Catches non-tRPC callers (workers, future webhook adapters, scripts) so a non-enterprise org never lands an IngestionSource row regardless of entry point. Asserts BEFORE `ensureHiddenGovernanceProject`. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **4b-5: Router-layer license gate** — `f8eec569b`. New `requireEnterprisePlan` tRPC middleware in `~/server/api/enterprise.ts`; 4 new `ENTERPRISE_FEATURE_ERRORS` entries (ANOMALY_RULES / ACTIVITY_MONITOR / INGESTION_SOURCES / OCSF_EXPORT); wired into **18 procedures** across `anomalyRules` / `activityMonitor` / `ingestionSources` routers + `governance.ocsfExport`. Composed **AFTER** `checkOrganizationPermission` so RBAC denial fires first (MEMBER → UNAUTHORIZED before FORBIDDEN). Apache-2.0 floor untouched: `aiTools.*`, `governance.setupState`, `governance.resolveHome`, `routingPolicies.*`. **Cross-lane mock fix bundled in same commit** per Alexis's `fa1f304d3` heads-up: `ingestionRoutes.integration.test.ts` `vi.mock(~/server/app-layer/app)` extended with `planProvider.getActivePlan → ENTERPRISE` so the 16 existing + 2 new auth-contract tests stay green; `governance.rbac.integration.test.ts` similarly overridden so its existing RBAC-focused "admin allows" tests continue to pass after the gate. |
| ✅ | 🅐 | **4b-6: CLI 402 Payment Required envelope** — `f3e4a2cab` (4 files, +224/-4). New `ensureEnterpriseOr402` helper in `langwatch/src/server/routes/auth-cli.ts` mirrors the tRPC `requireEnterprisePlan` middleware shape but speaks REST 402 (RFC 7231 §6.5.2) — wired into all 4 governance routes (status / ingest sources list / events / health), positioned after `validateAccessToken` so 401 fires first (no plan-info leakage to anon callers). Body shape: `{ error: "payment_required", error_description, upgrade_url }`. CLI side: `typescript-sdk/src/cli/utils/governance/cli-api.ts` `getJSON` now handles 402 alongside 401/404, throwing a `GovernanceCliError` whose message includes the upgrade URL on a separate click-targetable line — existing `Error: ${err.message}` surface in `commands/ingest/list.ts` + sibling commands renders verbatim, no command-side edits needed. Test extension: `auth-cli-governance.integration.test.ts` adopts the `createTestApp({planProvider})` per-org plan resolver pattern (orgs A+B → ENTERPRISE keeping the 16 existing RBAC/tenancy tests green; org C → FREE for the new 4-scenario license-gate subdescribe). New BDD spec: `specs/ai-gateway/governance/cli-402-license-gate.feature` (7 scenarios). |
| ✅ | 🅐 | **4b-7: "Available on Enterprise plans" docs callouts** — `071755498`. New "Open-core licensing" section in `/ai-governance/overview.mdx` with full Apache 2.0 / Enterprise split table; per-page `<Note>` callouts on `anomaly-rules.mdx`, `ingestion-sources/index.mdx`, `compliance-architecture.mdx` cross-linking back to the canonical split. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **4c-1: License-gate assertion test** — `f8eec569b`: new `license-gate-governance.integration.test.ts` (15 scenarios) + new `specs/ai-gateway/license-gate-governance.feature` BDD spec. Pinned: non-enterprise admin gets FORBIDDEN on every gated proc; MEMBER gets UNAUTHORIZED (RBAC fires first); Apache-2.0 floor stays open; service-layer `createSource` rejects direct calls; enterprise plan path validates allow-flow. 15 new + 11 existing governance.rbac tests + 15 existing ingestionRoutes tests all green. |
| ✅ | 🌐 | **4c-2**: Per-file license headers — canonical policy at `docs/ai-governance/overview.mdx#per-file-license-headers` (Andre `b6fef411b`). EE-tier production code carries the single line `// SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-LangWatch-Enterprise` at top of file before imports. Sweep complete: Lane-B `05e837dc2` (3 dashboard TSX files); Lane-S `a8aa293fb` (41 backend files: 4 reactors + 7 routers + 30 services incl. 8 pullers + 6 activity-monitor + 16 top-level). Tests under `ee/governance/**/__tests__/` intentionally excluded (orchestrator call 2026-05-03 — production-file-complete; expand only if rchaves dials test headers). |
| 📋 (only follow-up PR scope) | 🅐 | **4c-3**: Top-level `LICENSE` + `LICENSE-EE` files clarifying the split. **Per rchaves directive 2026-05-03, this is the ONLY item that ships on a separate cosmetic-only follow-up PR**. Everything else in Phase 4 lands in this PR. |
| ✅ | 🅐 | **4c-4: README open-core split** — landed in this batch. Apache 2.0 + Enterprise badge added to badge block. New §License — open-core split section replacing the legacy 1-line link: 2-row tier table (Apache 2.0 floor / Enterprise extension) mapping directories 1:1 to license; cross-links to `docs.langwatch.ai/ai-governance/overview#open-core-licensing` (layered enforcement) + `docs.langwatch.ai/self-hosting/compliance` (SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / GDPR / HIPAA / EU AI Act tier coverage); references `/LICENSE` (Apache 2.0) + `/LICENSE-EE` (Enterprise) — 4c-3 stays the only follow-up PR scope per rchaves. |

### Phase 2C — Anomaly action layer (Direction 2, P2) — `ee/`

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 🅢 | `spend_spike` Live rule type |
| ✅ | 🅑 | Composer trim — Preview-rule-types framing (`c4ea7bd60`) |
| ✅ (webhook MVP) | 🅢 | **C3 dispatch — webhook destination** — `e0880aa8a` (7 files, +866/-5). Mirrors `1f4ddd04c` strict+safe Zod pattern: new `destinationConfig.schema.ts` discriminated-union for `{ destinations: Array<{ type: "webhook", url, sharedSecret? }> }`; empty `{}` = explicit log-only opt-out. New `anomalyAlertDispatcher.service.ts` POSTs JSON with optional `X-LangWatch-Signature: sha256=<hmac>` when `sharedSecret` set; 5s timeout, retries 5xx ×2 with exp backoff (250→500ms), fails fast on 4xx; `FetchLike` dep-injected for hermetic tests. Evaluator now persists alert first (auth signal), dispatches, then patches `AnomalyAlert.detail.dispatch` with per-destination outcomes — concurrent dashboard reads see `pending` then outcome within ms. Validation at create/update; `translateConfigValidationError` disambiguates threshold vs destination ZodError from issue paths so admins see "Invalid destinationConfig: …" specifically. **Slack via incoming-webhook URL works today via webhook destination + small adapter; full Slack/PagerDuty/email channels + DLQ deferred to follow-ups (📋).** New BDD spec: `specs/ai-gateway/governance/c3-alert-dispatch.feature`. 8 new dispatcher integration tests + 12 existing threshold-config + 4 existing spend-spike all green. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **Structured threshold-config schema per rule type** — `1f4ddd04c` (6 files, +598/-49). New `thresholdConfig.schema.ts` with `spendSpikeThresholdConfigSchema` Zod + `validateThresholdConfig({ ruleType, config })` discriminator + `safeParseSpendSpikeThresholdConfig` for the evaluator's quarantine path. Wired through 3 layers: `anomalyRule.service.ts` `createRule` / `updateRule` strict-validate (covers ruleType-change-without-config edge case); `anomalyRules.ts` router `translateConfigValidationError` helper translates ZodError → `BAD_REQUEST` + "Unsupported ruleType" → `BAD_REQUEST` (mirrors aiTools router pattern); `spendSpikeAnomalyEvaluator.service.ts` replaced lenient `parseThresholdConfig` (which silently substituted `DEFAULT_SPEND_SPIKE_CONFIG`) with strict `safeParseSpendSpikeThresholdConfig` — stale rows now produce `skip_invalid_config` decision + warn-level log with rule id + zod issues. **Net behavior change**: snake_case typos / shape mismatches that previously fell through to defaults now reject at create/update + skip-with-warn at evaluation; the "admin types `ratio_vs_baseline: 5.0` but rule runs with `ratio=2.0`" foot-gun is closed. New BDD spec: `specs/ai-gateway/governance/anomaly-rule-threshold-schema.feature`. 12 new + 12 existing spend-spike unit tests + 4 existing spend-spike integration tests all green. |

### Phase 5 — GTM & release-readiness (round-up)

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 🅢 | **Volume regression test** — `b37859931` (1 file, +166/-7). Three layered changes on `ingestionRoutes.volume.integration.test.ts`: (1) `planProvider.getActivePlan → { type: "ENTERPRISE" }` mock-fix (beforeAll was silently skipping every scenario since Phase 4b-4/5; same shape as `f8eec569b` auth-contract extension); (2) new sustained-rate scenario — ~1k spans/sec target via 20 batched OTLP requests/sec × 50 spans/req for 3s ≈ 3000 spans, **open-loop pacing** (schedule each request at target offset regardless of previous completion) so it measures throughput under sustained pressure, not lockstep — asserts every POST 202, handleOtlpTraceRequest called exactly N times, p99 < 3000ms, observed throughput ≥ 50% of target; new `buildBatchedOtlpJsonBody(N)` helper for realistic exporter batch shapes; (3) threshold calibration on 2 pre-existing scenarios that had been silently failing — 50-concurrent bumped to 12000ms (still flags 2× regression; tighter budget requires fixing `recordEventReceived` row-lock contention — captured as follow-up below), 100-sequential bumped to 3000ms. **Honest signal logged**: with 50 concurrent POSTs hitting one source, every request races to UPDATE `IngestionSource.lastEventAt` → PG row-lock serialisation. Real traffic doesn't do this (exporters batch + spread across sources). 5 volume scenarios + 25 total ingest integration tests all green. |
| 📋 | 🅢 | **`recordEventReceived` row-lock contention** (post-merge follow-up, captured during volume regression `b37859931`). With concurrent POSTs hitting one source, every request races to UPDATE `IngestionSource.lastEventAt` → PG row-lock serialisation → p99 = O(N × per-update-cost). Fix: debounce/batch via Redis (per-source token-bucket-style coalescing of UPDATE timestamps), so high-RPS exporters land at most one DB write per source per N seconds. Out of in-PR scope. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **Cross-org concurrency test** — `c5cd7f49a` (1 file, +117; single-file extension to `ingestionRoutes.volume.integration.test.ts` per orchestrator narrowing). 50 orgs × 5 concurrent first-mints per org = 250 in-flight requests across 50 tenants — CI-sustainable shape that still hits the within-org P2002-catch path **200 times per run** stress-testing the 3-layer race-protection in `governanceProject.service.ts` (findFirst pre-check → findUnique slug pre-check → P2002 catch + re-fetch winner). Pins: every POST 202; each org has EXACTLY ONE hidden Gov Project under contention (slug-uniqueness invariant); cross-org isolation probe sampling 5 orgs verifies no Gov Project leaks through other orgs' team scope; handleOtlpTraceRequest invoked exactly 250 times; p99 < 15s loose budget (flags 3× regression without CI noise); 60s explicit test timeout (PG pool + per-org row-lock). No new file + no new BDD spec — `architecture-invariants.feature` already covers the lazy-ensure idempotency invariant; this is a load-pressure proof of the existing contract. All 6 volume scenarios + 32 total ingest integration tests green. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **Reactor backpressure** — `ee743b942` (1 file, +206/-2; single-file extension to `gatewayBudgetSync.reactor.integration.test.ts`). 3 new load-pressure scenarios characterising current reactor behaviour: (1) **Burst** — 100 distinct traces folded in parallel; every CH row lands; `service.check()` reflects exactly N × per-trace spend delta vs pre-burst baseline (concurrent fold doesn't drop or double-count); (2) **CH error swallow** — stub `insertDebit` to throw, `reactor.handle` resolves without throwing (pipeline isolation invariant: CH outage logs + captureException but never crashes the trace-fold worker); (3) **Same-trace replay** — 50 sequential `handle()` calls with same `gateway_request_id` collapse to one effective ledger row via probe-then-insert dedup at `budget.clickhouse.repository.ts:124` (extends existing 3-fire idempotency test to higher N). All 5 reactor scenarios pass (2 existing + 3 new). |
| 📋 | 🅢 | **Reactor parallel-same-id probe-race** (post-merge follow-up, captured during `ee743b942` reactor backpressure characterisation). The probe-then-insert dedup at `insertDebit` is NOT race-free under TRUE parallel same-id replay (N concurrent calls may all probe empty before any insert lands). Mitigated in production by the reactor's `makeJobId` TTL (5 min) sequentialising same-trace replay at the BullMQ layer. Fix: race-free dedup primitive (e.g. CH atomic SETNX-equivalent, or PG-side advisory-lock around the probe+insert pair). Out of in-PR scope. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **CH retention TTL atomicity** — `95919ba98` (1 file, +181/-19; single-file extension to `ingestionRoutes.integration.test.ts` per orchestrator narrowing). End-to-end receiver→handoff compliance invariant: for each retention class (`thirty_days` / `one_year` / `seven_years`) × 2 push receivers (OTLP + webhook) = 6 new scenarios, seed an IngestionSource, POST through the receiver, intercept the trace-pipeline / log-pipeline handoff, assert EVERY span / log_record carries `langwatch.governance.retention_class = <expected>`. Empty / missing / wrong all fail the invariant. OTLP test fires a 2-span body to prove stamping applies to ALL spans (catches for-of break / shared-reference bugs in `stampOriginAttrs`). Helper changes: `seedOrgWithIngestionSource({ retentionClass })` parameter; `buildOtlpJsonBody({ spanCount, spanNamePrefix })` opts. **Combined with existing `retentionClass.integration.test.ts` (CH-write-side direct-repo behavior)**, end-to-end invariant now covered: receiver stamps → handoff carries → CH writes right value → TTL clause matches. All 21 ingestionRoutes scenarios pass (15 existing + 6 new). |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **Receiver auth rate limiting** — `15c12842c` (5 files, +508). New `rateLimit.ts`: `checkIpRateLimit({ ip, windowSec, maxRequests, redis })` using Redis INCR+EXPIRE (fixed-window anchored on first hit), 60 req/min/IP defaults, open-fail when Redis unavailable, test-env opt-out via `LW_INGEST_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED=1`. `extractClientIp(headers)` honors X-Forwarded-For → X-Real-IP → "unknown". Wedged at top of POST `/otel/:sourceId` + POST `/webhook/:sourceId` so rate-limit fires BEFORE auth → DB lookup (scanners shed at L7 before their bearer token gets DB-looked-up). Returns 429 + `Retry-After` header on excess. `integration/setupEnv.ts` defaults the opt-out so volume / dogfood-smoke / auth-contract tests keep unfettered access; the new rate-limit test flips it OFF at module load + restores on teardown. 7 new rate-limit integration scenarios + 32 total ingest integration tests all green. New BDD spec: `specs/ai-gateway/governance/receiver-auth-rate-limit.feature`. |
| ✅ | 🅢 | **OCSF schema versioning column** — `5731fcdc6` (4 files, +365). New CH migration `00028_add_ocsf_schema_version.sql` adds `OcsfSchemaVersion LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT '1.1.0' AFTER TenantId` — DEFAULT materialises already-deployed rows as '1.1.0' on read so no backfill is needed. Repo exports new `OCSF_SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.1.0"` constant stamped on every `insertEvent` (single source of truth — future v1.2 = bump the constant). Read service SELECTs the column + adds `ocsfSchemaVersion` field to `GovernanceOcsfExportRow` so SIEM consumers can filter / version-gate downstream parsing. 3-scenario integration test pins: write path stamps constant; read path surfaces it; pre-column rows materialise as DEFAULT '1.1.0' (backwards compat proof). 13 existing OCSF reactor unit tests still green. |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **Browser-QA pass on enterprise-gating** — `abf12247c`. 5 screenshots at `docs/images/ai-governance/enterprise-gating/`: 2× non-enterprise-upsell shots (anomaly-rules + ingestion-sources, real FREE-tier render — dev defaults to FREE so no override needed) + 2× enterprise-content shots (no upsell flash) + 1× non-enterprise tool-catalog-ungated (proof of intentional Apache-2.0 floor). **Bug fix rode along**: `ingestion-source-detail.tsx` had a `if (!source) return Spinner` short-circuit that bypassed the `EnterpriseLockedSurface` wrap — non-enterprise users hit a spinner forever; the spinner branch now also wraps in `EnterpriseLockedSurface`. *Deferred follow-up*: ingestion-source-detail page-level non-enterprise shot waits on Sergey's 4b-4/5 service-layer 403 + an IngestionSource seeded on the dogfood org. |
| ✅ | 🅐 | **Self-hosted compliance docs** — `84efb3e1e` (4 files, +353/-0; new `docs/self-hosting/compliance.mdx` + `docs.json` wire-up under Operations group). Coverage: TL;DR open-core split table (15 capabilities × tier), SOC 2 Type II TSC mapping (CC6.1/6.6/6.7/7.1/7.2/7.4/8.1 with tier), ISO 27001 same shape, GDPR Art. 30/32/33/35 with per-article tier, HIPAA §164.312 with "HIPAA-most-uses" framing + 6yr audit log gate, EU AI Act Art. 12 + Art. 18, "what's intentionally unavailable on Apache 2.0" design boundaries, migration path (no schema migration; env-flip). Cross-links to `compliance-architecture` (substrate) + `overview#open-core-licensing` (enforcement) + `self-hosting/{security,configuration/sso}`. |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **Cross-org isolation smoke at HTTP receiver layer** — `fa1f304d3` (+32/-0, single file: `ingestionRoutes.integration.test.ts`). Coverage-gap closure: `/api/ingest/otel/` already had cross-org tenant isolation tested (orgA bearer + orgB sourceId path → 401); `/api/ingest/webhook/` only had source-type-routing + happy-path. New 'auth contract' subdescribe under `POST /api/ingest/webhook/` adds 2 cases: missing `Authorization` header → 401; orgA bearer used against orgB sourceId path param → 401 (uses existing `workatoSeed` + `crossOrgSeed` fixtures). **Cross-lane dependency note**: when Sergey's 4b-4/5 service-layer 403 lands (`assertEnterprisePlan` in `IngestionSourceService.createSource`), the existing `vi.mock(~/server/app-layer/app)` block in this test file will need to be extended with `planProvider: { getActivePlan: () => Promise.resolve({ type: 'ENTERPRISE', ... }) }` so the 16 existing tests + 2 new auth-contract cases continue to pass through the enterprise-plan gate during seed setup. Sergey owns folding that mock-extension into his 4b-4/5 commit. |
| ✅ | 🅑 | **End-to-end customer dogfood smoke test** — `14f2782de` (+331/-0, isolated `dogfood-smoke.e2e.integration.test.ts`). Mints two orgs end-to-end + IngestionSource each, then proves: (1) receiver bearer→202 + handoff to `handleOtlpTraceRequest` with Gov Project tenant + origin metadata stamped on spans; (2) `lastEventAt` advances on Prisma after POST (composer awaiting→active downstream); (3) dashboard tRPC: orgA admin sees orgA source via `ingestionSources.list`; (4) Layer-1 cross-org isolation: orgB admin can't see orgA via list, calling list with orgA orgId → FORBIDDEN/UNAUTHORIZED. Reuses Sergey's `configureApp + createTestApp({planProvider})` pattern; `vi.mock` wraps `getApp` via Proxy to swap only `traces.collection` so `planProvider` stays from the configured app and the license gate fires naturally. Complements `fa1f304d3` (receiver-layer auth-contract isolation) with data-layer Prisma isolation. |

### Phase 7 — AI Tools Portal on /me (NEW per rchaves directive 2026-05-03)

> **Concept (rchaves quote, condensed)**: "/me dashboard becomes the customizable portal for AI tools for the whole company." Card-grid landing surface for users after `langwatch login` (without subcommand) or generic dashboard entry. Three tile classes: coding assistants → click expands to setup helper; model providers → click expands to inline VK creation; external tools → admin-attached markdown description + external link. Admin catalog editor at `/settings/governance/tool-catalog` defines org-wide + team-scoped tile list. Default empty + starter-pack import CTA in empty state.
>
> **Lane split (locked by master_orchestrator)**: 🅐 architecture spine + ASCII wireframes + Gantt + BDD file list + PR narrative fold; 🅑 portal UI + admin catalog editor + click-to-expand flows + dogfood/screenshots; 🅢 backend schema/API/RBAC + integration tests + inline VK reuse.

#### Architecture spine (Lane-S surface map — Sergey, kanban 2026-05-03)

**1 new Prisma model** (org-scoped, exempt from projectId middleware) — no migrations to existing models, no derivation from `Provider` / `ExternalTool`:

```prisma
model AiToolCatalogEntry {
  id              String   @id @default(nanoid())
  organizationId  String
  organization    Organization @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  scope           String   // "organization" | "team"
  scopeId         String   // organizationId or teamId
  type            String   // "coding_assistant" | "model_provider" | "external_tool"
  displayName     String
  slug            String   // icon lookup key (e.g. "claude-code", "openai")
  iconKey         String?  // overrides slug-derived icon
  order           Int      @default(0)
  enabled         Boolean  @default(true)
  config          Json     // discriminated union per-type
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
  archivedAt      DateTime?
  createdById     String?
  updatedById     String?

  @@index([organizationId, scope, scopeId])
  @@index([organizationId, enabled, archivedAt])
}
```

`config` JSON shape (TS discriminated union, app-layer validated):
- `coding_assistant`: `{ setupCommand, setupDocsUrl, helperText? }`
- `model_provider`: `{ providerKey, suggestedRoutingPolicyId?, defaultLabel?, projectSuggestionText? }`
- `external_tool`: `{ descriptionMarkdown, linkUrl, ctaLabel? }`

**RBAC catalog additions** (2 lines + 1 rbac.test.ts case):
- `AI_TOOLS: "aiTools"` new Resource
- `aiTools:view` → ADMIN + MEMBER + EXTERNAL (portal must work for everyone)
- `aiTools:manage` → ADMIN only

**1 new tRPC router** `aiToolsCatalogRouter`:
- `list({ organizationId, scope?, scopeId? })` — gates on `aiTools:view`, enabled + non-archived only, team entries override org entries by slug
- `adminList({ organizationId })` — gates on `aiTools:manage`, includes disabled + archived
- `create / update / archive / setEnabled / reorder` — admin mutations gated on `aiTools:manage`

**Reuse map** (almost zero new backend code beyond the catalog itself):

| Tile click | Backend |
|---|---|
| Coding-assistant → expand setup | NONE (docs-only, uses existing `langwatch login` device-flow) |
| Model-provider → inline VK creation | **REUSES** `personalVirtualKeys.issuePersonal` — pass `routingPolicyId` from `config.suggestedRoutingPolicyId` |
| External-tool → open link | NONE (markdown render via existing sanitizer + `linkUrl` href) |

**Open-question resolutions (master_orchestrator, 2026-05-03)**:
- Default catalog: **empty at org creation** + starter-pack import CTA in empty state.
- External-tool markdown: **reuse existing renderer/HTML sanitizer**; do not invent a new one.
- Multi-tenancy: org-scoped → add `AiToolCatalogEntry` to `EXEMPT_MODELS` in prisma middleware (org-scoped, no projectId).

#### ASCII wireframes (Lane-A spine — Alexis owns finished mockups in dogfood)

#### Phase 7 atomic-task Gantt — AI Tools Portal

| Step | Description | Owner | Critical path |
|---|---|---|---|
| P7-arch ✅ | Architecture spine + ASCII wireframes + Gantt + BDD file list + PR narrative fold (`5e63887ef`) | 🅐 (`5e63887ef`) | ✓ |
| P7-schema ✅ | `AiToolEntry` Prisma model (org-scoped) + migration `20260503000000_add_ai_tool_entry` (3 indexes) + `EXEMPT_MODELS` entry in `dbMultiTenancyProtection.ts` | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda`) | ✓ |
| P7-rbac ✅ | `AI_TOOLS = "aiTools"` resource added to `rbac.ts`. `aiTools:view` granted to ADMIN + MEMBER + EXTERNAL (portal works for everyone). `aiTools:manage` granted to ADMIN only. `permissionsConfig.ts` `orderedResources` adds `AI_TOOLS` for custom-role builder UI. | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda`) | ✓ |
| P7-router ✅ | `aiToolsRouter` (new tRPC, **8 procedures** post-`5a3219ae0`: `list` + `adminList` + `get` + `create` + `update` + `archive` + `setEnabled` + `reorder`) + `AiToolEntryService` with team-overrides-org-by-slug resolution + zod-discriminated-union per-type `config` validation. `setEnabled` added as single-purpose enable/disable shorthand matching `admin-catalog-editor.feature` contract exactly. Matches Alexis's B1-B6 scaffold contract 1:1. | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda` + `5a3219ae0`) | ✓ |
| P7-vk-reuse ✅ | No new endpoint — model-provider tile click reuses existing `personalVirtualKeys.issuePersonal` with `config.suggestedRoutingPolicyId` passed through. Confirmed wire-ready in `vk-bridge` spec. | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda`) | ✓ |
| P7-md-render ✅ (no-code-change) | External-tool description rendering uses the existing markdown sanitizer (CR-confirmed: no new sanitizer code, reuse the established path). Lane-B B4 `ExternalToolTile` already wires it. | 🅢 (no commit — confirmed reuse) | |
| P7-int-test ✅ | `aiTools.integration.test.ts` — **7/7 green**. Pins RBAC (MEMBER 401 on writes, ADMIN OK), scoping (team-overrides-org by slug), per-type `config` validation (BAD_REQUEST on bad shape), `setEnabled` round-trip. Migration deployed to dev DB so the test ran end-to-end. | 🅢 (`5a3219ae0`) | ✓ |
| P7-spec-rbac ✅ | `specs/ai-governance/personal-portal/tool-catalog-rbac.feature` — admin manages, member lists, external-only assigned | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda`) | |
| P7-spec-scope ✅ | `specs/ai-governance/personal-portal/tool-catalog-scoping.feature` — team-scope-overrides-org-by-slug; disabled hidden from list / visible in adminList | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda`) | |
| P7-spec-vkbridge ✅ | `specs/ai-governance/personal-portal/tool-catalog-vk-bridge.feature` — model-provider tile click → `issuePersonal` with `suggestedRoutingPolicyId`, includes regression scenario for the cross-org policy guard from `17047a301` | 🅢 (`6c1be0cda`) | |
| P7-spec-portal ✅ | `portal-grid.feature` (73 LOC, 6 scenarios) — /me layout, section ordering, empty states, team-overrides-org by slug, disabled-entry hiding, FF gate | 🅑 (`b846c7b20`) | |
| P7-spec-coding ✅ | `coding-assistant-tile.feature` (63 LOC, 6 scenarios) — click-to-expand, copy-to-clipboard with bare-command (no leading `$`), optional setupDocsUrl link, no backend mutation on expand | 🅑 (`b846c7b20`) | |
| P7-spec-provider ✅ | `model-provider-tile.feature` (93 LOC, 8 scenarios) — inline VK form, label validation, `issuePersonal` mutation contract (passes `config.suggestedRoutingPolicyId`), reveal/copy secret toggles, **409 `no_default_routing_policy` inline error path** (ties `49f81be4f` 409 fix into portal UX), "Issue another" reset | 🅑 (`b846c7b20`) | |
| P7-spec-external ✅ | `external-tool-tile.feature` (76 LOC, 6 scenarios) — admin markdown render via existing sanitizer, sanitization strips script tags, CTA button `target=_blank rel=noopener`, no backend | 🅑 (`b846c7b20`) | |
| P7-spec-admin ✅ | `admin-catalog-editor.feature` (134 LOC, 11 scenarios) — `aiTools:manage` gate, 3 sections always visible (incl. empty-state callouts), per-row drag/scope-badge/edit/disable shape, drawer field map per type discriminator, save-fires-create vs edit-fires-update, reorder mutation contract, setEnabled round-trip, UI-preview banner while router unwired | 🅑 (`b846c7b20`) | |
| P7-B1 ✅ | Portal shell + section grouping + empty state — `components/me/AiToolsPortal.tsx` (3-section grid, section-empty hides, totally-empty shows CLI-fallback callout) | 🅑 (`16e3af8fe`) | ✓ |
| P7-B2 ✅ | `components/me/tiles/CodingAssistantTile.tsx` — click-expand → command + copy + walkthrough text | 🅑 (`16e3af8fe`) | |
| P7-B3 ✅ | `components/me/tiles/ModelProviderTile.tsx` — click-expand → label-only VK form → success state w/ masked secret + reveal/copy + base URL + 💡 project-suggestion hint (mocked VK; B9 swaps to real `personalVirtualKeys.issuePersonal`) | 🅑 (`16e3af8fe`) | ✓ |
| P7-B4 ✅ | `components/me/tiles/ExternalToolTile.tsx` — click-expand → markdown body + external-link CTA + `tiles/{types,mockCatalog}.ts` mirroring Sergey's contract 1:1 | 🅑 (`16e3af8fe`) | |
| P7-B5 ✅ | `pages/me/index.tsx` — portal hero ABOVE existing usage dashboard (single URL, no ferry) | 🅑 (`16e3af8fe`) | ✓ |
| P7-B6 ✅ (list + route) | Admin route + list view: `pages/settings/governance/tool-catalog.tsx` (FF-gated, UI-preview banner) + `components/settings/governance/ToolCatalogEditor.tsx` (section-grouped list, drag handles, `+Add tile` per-section, scope badge). B7 drawer pending. | 🅑 (`16e3af8fe`) | ✓ |
| P7-B7 ✅ | `AiToolEntryDrawer` — admin add/edit drawer wired to `api.aiTools.create` + `api.aiTools.update`. 592 LOC + 14 LOC tool-catalog.tsx wiring, typecheck clean. **Type radio** (coding_assistant / model_provider / external_tool; locked on edit per spec). **Per-type fields**: coding (setupCommand required + helperText + setupDocsUrl), provider (providerKey required + defaultLabel + suggestedRoutingPolicyId + projectSuggestionText), external (descriptionMarkdown + linkUrl both required + ctaLabel). **Common**: displayName + slug (both required — slug drives icon lookup + team-overrides-org matching). **Scope picker**: whole-org / specific-team radio + team-id input. Save invalidates both adminList + user-facing list + toast. Drawer shape matches `SeriesFiltersDrawer` + `anomaly-rules` page. | 🅑 (`2ef74b8df`) | |
| P7-B8 ✅ | Drag-to-reorder — `ToolCatalogEditor` wraps each section in its own `DndContext` + `verticalListSortingStrategy`; drag-end fires `api.aiTools.reorder` with the section's full `{id, order}` list, optimistic adminList cache update with inline rollback on error. `GripVertical` box (cursor: grab) is the drag handle; rows isolate by section so no cross-type drops. | 🅑 (`84d7844b4`) | |
| P7-B9 ✅ | UI wired end-to-end to Sergey's `aiToolsCatalogRouter`. 4 files (133+/58-, typecheck clean): `AiToolsPortal` → `api.aiTools.list({ organizationId })`; `ToolCatalogEditor` → `api.aiTools.adminList` + Disable/Enable toggle fires `api.aiTools.setEnabled` with cache invalidation on both lists; `ModelProviderTile` → real `api.personalVirtualKeys.issuePersonal` passing `config.suggestedRoutingPolicyId` as `routingPolicyId`, `isPending` → "Issuing…" label, `onError` surfaces inline red callout (catches 409 `no_default_routing_policy` per spec); `tool-catalog.tsx` drops the orange "UI preview only" banner. `mockCatalog.ts` retained for B7/B8 component-test fixtures only (not in production path). | 🅑 (`9518af22f`) | ✓ |
| P7-starter-pack 📋 (deferred v2) | Starter-pack JSON seed import — deferred to v2 follow-up per master_orchestrator decision. v1 admin path: empty catalog + manual `+ Add tile` per entry. The `Import starter pack ▸` CTA in the empty-state mockup is a v2 affordance; v1 admin sees `+ Add tile` only. | 🅢 | |
| P7-B10 ✅ | Live-data dogfood — 9 PNGs at `docs/images/ai-governance/portal/`: `portal-empty`, `portal-hero-populated`, `tile-claude-expanded`, `tile-anthropic-form`, `tile-anthropic-issued`, `tile-copilot-studio`, `admin-catalog-overview`, `admin-add-tile-drawer`, `admin-scope-picker`. **Two bug fixes rode along (caught during dogfood, fixed same commit)**: (1) `/settings/governance/tool-catalog` was 404'ing because the Vite migration killed Next.js Pages-router auto-discovery — added explicit registration in `routes.tsx`. (2) `tool-catalog.tsx` was rendering `<NotFoundScene />` on first paint before `useOrganizationTeamProject` resolved org — swapped to `<LoadingScreen />` while org loads, then `NotFoundScene` only on FF-disabled. | 🅑 (`25dea5fdd`) | ✓ |
| P7-B11 ✅ | Empty / error polish (5 files, +81/-2): new `TileIcon` component reuses existing `modelProviderIcons` (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini / Azure / etc.) with type-discriminated lucide fallback (`Bot` / `Boxes` / `Wrench`). Wired `iconKey` through all 3 tiles + dispatch. ModelProviderTile falls back to `config.providerKey` so brand icon lights up without admin setting `iconKey`. AiToolsPortal: 3-section skeleton during `query.isLoading` kills the empty→populated flicker. Error-toast hooks already in place on `AiToolEntryDrawer:204-215`; no-op there. Refreshed `portal-hero-populated.png` (`deef94c2e`) so docs reflect polished tiles. Browser-verified: icons render correctly, no flicker on cold load. | 🅑 (`263999bab` + `deef94c2e`) | |
| P7-B12 ✅ (image absorption) | All 9 B10 dogfood PNGs absorbed into the 3 docs scaffolds (`f2c6db222`): `overview.mdx` gets the populated-hero + empty-state shots; `admin-catalog.mdx` gets catalog-overview + add-tile-drawer + scope-picker; `end-user.mdx` gets tile-claude-expanded + anthropic-form/issued + copilot-studio. Docs pages now serve double-duty as inline imagery + dogfood visual proof. | 🅐 (`f2c6db222`) | |
| P7-docs ✅ (scaffold) | `docs/ai-governance/personal-portal/{overview,admin-catalog,end-user}.mdx` shipped (3 pages, 393 LOC) + `docs.json` Personal Portal group inserted between "Get Started" and "Sources" inside AI Governance anchor (`3d8a5d3c8`). Cross-links live: `personal-keys` (device-flow trigger), `routing-policies` (policy chain), `cli-debug` (error catalog). Screenshots from P7-dogfood will fold into all 3 pages once Alexis ships those. | 🅐 (`3d8a5d3c8`) | ✓ |
| P7-fold | 🅐 Andre folds each batch into PR body + re-PATCHes (this row stays open until P7-dogfood lands) | 🅐 | |

Critical path: **P7-arch → P7-schema → P7-router (+ P7-vk-reuse, P7-rbac, P7-int-test) → P7-B1/B5 (portal shell + me/index embed) → P7-B3 (ModelProviderTile) → P7-B6 (admin route + list) → P7-B9 (wire-up) → P7-B10 (dogfood)**. **Phase 7 critical path CLEARED as of `25dea5fdd`** (P7-arch ✅ / P7-schema ✅ / P7-rbac ✅ / P7-router ✅ / P7-vk-reuse ✅ / P7-md-render ✅ via reuse / P7-int-test ✅ + 8/8 BDD specs ✅ + B1-B6 UI scaffolds ✅ + B7 admin drawer ✅ + B8 drag-reorder ✅ + B9 router-wire ✅ + B10 dogfood ✅ + docs scaffold ✅). Remaining items (B11 polish + B12 docs follow-up + P7-md-render reuse confirmation) are all non-blocking. **P7-starter-pack** stays deferred to v2.

**Post-merge audit follow-up CLEARED** (caught during B10 dogfood, swept by Alexis pre-B11): the Vite migration killed Next.js Pages-router auto-discovery; `tool-catalog.tsx` 404'd until explicit registration was added in `routes.tsx` (`25dea5fdd`). Audit sweep complete — all 4 governance subpages (`tool-catalog`, `anomaly-rules`, `ingestion-sources`, `ingestion-source-detail`) verified registered in `routes.tsx`. No further action required.

#### BDD spec file list (8 files, 3 lane-S backend / 5 lane-B UX)

```

```

Total: 8 feature files. Lane-S writes the 3 backend invariants (RBAC, scoping, VK-bridge); Lane-B writes the 5 UX flows. Lane-A (me) folds each batch into PR narrative as it ships.

#### Implementation split for dogfood + screenshots (Lane-B owns)

After P7-ui-shell + P7-ui-provider + P7-ui-admin land, capture:
1. **Portal grid populated** — admin home with 4 coding-assistants + 4 providers + 2 externals
2. **Empty state** — fresh-org admin view with "Import starter pack" CTA
3. **Coding-assistant expanded** — Claude Code tile expanded, copy buttons highlighted
4. **Model-provider expanded** — OpenAI tile expanded, key just generated, success toast visible
5. **External-tool expanded** — Copilot Studio tile expanded, markdown rendered, external link visible
6. **Admin catalog list** — `/settings/governance/tool-catalog` populated
7. **Admin upsert drawer** — external-tool drawer mid-edit
8. **Starter-pack import** — admin-side import-confirm modal + success toast + grid populated post-import

All shots commit to `dev/dogfood-screenshots/phase-7-portal/` and embed inline via raw GitHub URLs in PR doc + the 3 new docs pages.

### Pending-phase status snapshot (rchaves directive 2026-05-03)

Quick state of the still-pending Phase 1B.5 / 2C / 2D / 4 / 5 work, surfaced for parallel-track triage so Phase 7 doesn't stall them. Owner emojis match the Gantt rows above.

| Phase | Open items (count) | Blocking critical path? | Parallel-OK with Phase 7? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1B / 1B.5** | **Lane-S 1B closed** as of `4d83d4ff1` (PRINCIPAL cascade backend ✅ + CLI token revoke on deactivation ✅ + 2 BDD specs + 9 integration tests). **1B-followup-1 closed** as of `717745384` (PRINCIPAL admin UI in `BudgetCreateDrawer`). **Lane-B 1B.5 polish open**: 5 ⏳ (1.5b-ii Screen 2 single-input email-only `/signin-cli`, 1.5b-iii Screen 4 ceremony, 1.5b-iv Screen 6 polish, 1.5b-v Screen 7 polish, 1.5b-vi Screen 8 BudgetExceededBanner web-side enrichment, 1.5a-marketing draft). **Remaining follow-up (📋)**: 1B-followup-2 admin "revoke this user's CLI sessions" affordance (Phase 5 polish, deferred). | No | ✓ — Lane-B rotates between Screen polish + parallel 2C/2D/4/5 |
| **Phase 2C** | 2 ⏳ in-PR scope (C3 dispatch — Slack/PagerDuty/SIEM/email; structured threshold-config schema per rule type) — both 🅢; 5 📋 backlog (Live rule types + revocation automations) | No | ✓ — Lane-S can rotate between portal backend + 2C dispatch |
| **Phase 2D** | 5 ⏳ (3 puller workers — copilot_studio / openai_compliance / claude_compliance; 2 webhook adapters — workato job-array unwrap, s3_custom DSL) — all 🅢 | No | ✓ — pure Lane-S backend, fully parallel with portal |
| **Phase 4** | **Vote H OVERRIDDEN per rchaves directive 2026-05-03 — everything except literal LICENSE root file is back in-PR.** 4b CLOSED on all 3 lanes (✅ 4b-1/2/3/4/5/6/7 + 4c-1, see Phase 4 detail above). **Production sweep COMPLETE**: 4a-1/2/3 ✅ (relocations); 4a-tRPC ✅ (`73c39d443`); 4c-2 ✅ (Lane-B `05e837dc2` 3 files + Lane-S `a8aa293fb` 41 files; tests intentionally excluded); 4c-4 ✅ (`abbb0cb6c`). **Only 4c-3 stays follow-up PR** (literal root LICENSE/LICENSE-EE files). | Yes (gates GA per rchaves) | ✓ — Phase 4 in-PR scope effectively closed |
| **Phase 8 — Sessions/Devices** (NEW) | Architecture-spine row above. Backend ✅ (`82ae4b666`); UI `/me/sessions` ✅ (`1e7360a8f`); admin max-TTL section ✅ (`890f5e5d5`); BDD specs + docs scaffold ✅ (`bd4875f56`); ⏳ remaining: P8-dogfood (browser-side capture, queued behind Docker recovery). | Yes (rchaves explicit ask) | ✓ |
| **Phase 9 — Gateway no-spy mode** (NEW) | Architecture-spine row above. Backend ✅ (`6433e3e14`); UI `<ContentModeSection />` ✅ (`d6f2f5178`); BDD specs + docs scaffold ✅ (`bd4875f56`); ⏳ remaining: P9-dogfood (queued behind Docker recovery). | Yes (rchaves explicit ask) | ✓ |
| **Phase 10 — Pull-mode framework** (NEW) | Architecture-spine row above. Backend ✅ (`3fdf6626b` + `5c084ceca` + `17dafb79e` + `38ccf82f0` + `4cd210b33` — adapter contract + http + s3 + event-sink + 3 reference impls + worker-dispatch coverage); UI composer ✅ (`0c9c0f166`); BDD specs + docs scaffold ✅ (`bd4875f56`); **Phase 10 effectively feature-complete** modulo Docker-blocked items: ⏳ remaining = P10-dogfood (Lane-B) + full PG+CH integration test (currently mocked at storage edges; testContainers swap is the only delta). | Yes (rchaves explicit ask — closes the Phase 2D gap) | ✓ |
| **Phase 11 — CLI wrapper e2e in CI** (NEW) | Architecture-spine row above. Backend ✅ (`d7c59436d` — single chunk: spec + harness + per-wrapper for **all 5 tools** including cursor/gemini, since assertion shape was line-for-line identical; 16/16 passing in 3s, no Docker, no live LLM). BDD specs ✅ (sister specs `bd4875f56` + concrete pin `d7c59436d`); ⏳ remaining: P11-ui-handoff (Lane-B Playwright check on device-flow OAuth page) + P11-docs (verified-e2e note in personal-keys + cli-debug pages). | Yes (rchaves explicit ask) | ✓ |

### Phase 8 — Sessions / Devices dashboard (NEW per rchaves directive 2026-05-03)

> **Concept**: When a user runs `langwatch login` to start a Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Gemini CLI session, the device-flow exchange mints a personal Virtual Key behind the scenes. Today there's no way for the user to see "where am I logged in?" the way macOS shows logged-in devices, GitHub shows active sessions, or Apple ID shows trusted devices. This phase adds the inventory + revoke + admin-controlled max-session-TTL.
>
> **Lane split**: 🅢 backend (CliSession model, device-info capture in `/exchange`, list+revoke API, max-TTL enforcement at `/refresh`); 🅑 UI (`/me/sessions` page + admin org-setting for max session TTL); 🅐 BDD specs + docs page.

| Step | Description | Owner | Critical path |

| P8-schema ✅ | Extend AccessTokenRecord + RefreshTokenRecord with `device_label` + `device_uname` + `client_platform` + `created_at` + `last_used_at`. New Prisma migration adds `Organization.maxSessionDurationDays Int @default(0)` (0 = unbounded). | 🅢 (`82ae4b666`) | ✓ |
| P8-exchange ✅ | `auth-cli.ts /exchange` accepts `client_info: { device_label?, uname?, hostname?, platform? }` from request body; stamps both AccessToken + RefreshToken records. CLI side (typescript-sdk): `device-flow.ts` populates `client_info` from `os.hostname()` + `os.userInfo().username` + `os.platform()`. | 🅢 (`82ae4b666`) | ✓ |
| P8-refresh-ttl ✅ | `auth-cli.ts /refresh` enforces `maxSessionDurationDays` — when the org has a TTL set and `(now - issued_at) > TTL`, return 401 + `error: "session_expired"` so the CLI prompts re-login. Default 0 = unbounded. | 🅢 (`82ae4b666`) | |
| P8-list-api ✅ | New `cliSessionInventoryService` groups rotated tokens by `session_started_at` so the UI sees one card per logical session, not one per access-token rotation; new `personalSessions.{list,revoke,revokeAll}` tRPC router wired into `appRouter`. | 🅢 (`82ae4b666`) | ✓ |

| P8-ui-sessions ✅ | `pages/me/sessions.tsx` (~340 LOC) consumes `api.personalSessions.{list,revoke,revokeAll}`; one card per logical session (CliSessionInventoryService dedup by `session_started_at` so access-token rotation doesn't multiply rows); per-card `device_label` + hostname/uname subline + platform badge + lastSeen relative + expiresAt absolute; per-card Revoke + top-right "Revoke all" with inline red confirmation strip (matches `/me/settings` ApiKeyRow dance); empty state pointing at `langwatch login`; FF-gated on `release_ui_ai_governance_enabled`; new `Sessions` link in `PersonalSidebar.tsx` above Settings; explicit `/me/sessions` registration in `routes.tsx` (Vite-pattern matches tool-catalog repair). | 🅑 (`1e7360a8f`) | ✓ |

### Phase 9 — Gateway no-spy mode (Privacy / drop-content admin setting) (NEW per rchaves directive 2026-05-03)

> **Concept (rchaves quote, condensed)**: "many orgs can't spy on their employee chats". Today every gateway request lands its prompt + completion + system message in ClickHouse. Many enterprises have policies that prohibit storing conversational content even briefly. This phase adds an org/team-scoped admin setting that **completely drops** the content payload — never stored to ClickHouse, not even briefly.
>
> **Lane split**: 🅢 backend (org-scoped setting, receiver-side filter strips `gen_ai.prompt.*` / `gen_ai.completion.*` / `gen_ai.system_message.*` BEFORE CH ingest, integration test asserts CH never sees content); 🅑 UI (toggle in org settings + clear callout); 🅐 BDD specs + docs.

| Step | Description | Owner | Critical path |

| P9-schema ✅ | Prisma migration `20260503020000`: `Organization.governanceLogContentMode String @default("full")` — values `"full"` / `"strip_io"` / `"strip_all"`. `organization.factory.ts` sets `'full'` default. | 🅢 (`6433e3e14`) | ✓ |
| P9-strip-service ✅ | `ee/governance/services/governanceContentStrip.service.ts` (235 LOC) — pure strip transform of `gen_ai.prompt.*` / `gen_ai.completion.*` / `gen_ai.system_message.*` / (in `strip_all`) `gen_ai.tool_call.*`; 30s TTL-cached single-flight mode resolver per org; **fail-CLOSED to `strip_io` on Prisma errors** (defensive default — when in doubt, drop content rather than risk leaking). 14 unit tests in `governanceContentStrip.service.unit.test.ts`. | 🅢 (`6433e3e14`) | ✓ |
| P9-pipeline-wire ✅ | Strip applied in `spanStorage.store.ts` `append`/`bulkAppend` BEFORE the CH insert. Wire-in chosen at the AppendStore layer (not the MapProjection) because handlers there are sync but the Prisma mode lookup is async — store layer is the cleanest async extension point that still guarantees policy fires pre-CH-write. | 🅢 (`6433e3e14`) | ✓ |
| P9-router ✅ | `ee/governance/routers/sessionPolicy.ts` extended with `setContentMode` + `contentMode` field on `get` (per Alexis sibling-add suggestion + orchestrator same-page placement call). `setContentMode({ organizationId, contentMode })` requires `organization:manage`. | 🅢 (`6433e3e14`) | ✓ |
| P9-int-test ✅ | `governanceContentStrip.integration.test.ts` — full / strip_io / strip_all / cross-org isolation / non-gateway-origin pass-through. Runs in CI; locally pending Docker recovery. | 🅢 (`6433e3e14`) | ✓ |
| P9-spec ✅ | `specs/ai-governance/no-spy-mode/no-spy-mode.feature` — 7 scenarios pinning each mode's storage behavior (full / strip_io / strip_all), cross-org isolation, non-gateway-origin spans untouched (origin discriminator), forward-looking-only mode flips (no historical rewrite), ADMIN-only permission gate. | 🅐 (this commit) | |
| P9-ui ✅ | New `<ContentModeSection />` card rendered between `<SessionPolicySection />` and "By user" in `/settings/governance/index.tsx`. **Two-card layout (NOT a single shared card)** — orchestrator-accepted rationale 2026-05-03: session lifetime and content retention are different policy axes (one limits re-login frequency, the other limits what hits CH at rest). Three click-to-select cards (macOS System Settings radio-card pattern, whole-card click target) with radio-style indicator: **full** (prompts + completions + system messages all persist) / **strip_io** (drops prompts + completions, keeps system msgs + cost/latency/span shape) / **strip_all** (drops everything user-content-shaped, only metadata persists). Active selection = orange accent + "active" badge. `setMutation.variables?.contentMode` fades the in-flight card. Footer copy (matches required forward-looking framing): "Mode flips apply to new spans only. Spans already in ClickHouse are NOT retroactively scrubbed." Consumes `api.sessionPolicy.{get,setContentMode}` from `6433e3e14`. | 🅑 (`d6f2f5178`) | ✓ |

### Phase 10 — Pull-mode connector framework + sample worker (NEW per rchaves directive 2026-05-03)

> **Concept (rchaves quote, condensed)**: copilot_studio / openai_compliance / claude_compliance are setup-contract-only today. Need a **sample puller worker actually working**, plus a **universal way for users to define pull logic** for arbitrary S3 / HTTP / etc. Industry-standard inspirations: Singer Tap, Airbyte CDK, Apache Camel, Kafka Connect.
>
> **Lane split**: 🅢 backend (`PullerAdapter` abstraction + 2 universal adapters — HTTP polling + S3 polling + 1 reference impl using one of them + BullMQ worker + Prisma schema field); 🅑 admin UI for "Add pull source" drawer w/ per-type config; 🅐 BDD specs + docs.

| Step | Description | Owner | Critical path |
|---|---|---|---|
| P10-arch | Architecture spine + Gantt + BDD file list (THIS COMMIT — narrative) | 🅐 | ✓ |
| P10-adapter-iface ✅ | `ee/governance/services/pullers/pullerAdapter.ts` — universal contract: `validateConfig` + `runOnce({ cursor })` → `{ events, cursor, errorCount }`. Singer Tap / Airbyte CDK / Apache Camel pattern. Singleton registry keyed by adapter id; importing `index.ts` once at startup wires both built-in adapters. 12 unit tests passing. | 🅢 (`3fdf6626b`) | ✓ |
| P10-http-adapter ✅ | `httpPollingPullerAdapter.ts` — generic HTTP-polling adapter with JSON-path mapping, `${{credentials.X}}` template substitution, cursor-as-query-param OR absolute next-link URL support (Microsoft Graph pattern), 4xx-fail-fast / 5xx-retry-with-backoff, SSRF-safe via `ssrfSafeFetch`. | 🅢 (`3fdf6626b`) | ✓ |
| P10-s3-adapter ✅ | `S3PollingPullerAdapter` — universal S3-polling adapter for SaaS audit-log dumps (Anthropic compliance / OpenAI enterprise audit / customer S3-to-archive pipelines). **Cursor**: lexicographic-max key seen so far; resume = `ListObjectsV2(StartAfter: cursor)` — any sane file-naming scheme yields a monotonically increasing key stream that drains deterministically. **Parsers**: `ndjson` / `json-array` / `csv` (RFC4180-ish with quoted-field handling); bad ndjson lines silently skipped (parseNdjson absorbs); read-failures advance cursor anyway per spec (no infinite re-pull on broken files; operator alerting via `errorCount`). **Safety caps**: 50 MB/file, 100 keys/runOnce, fresh S3 client per runOnce so credential rotation propagates immediately, soft deadline support. 10 unit tests (validateConfig, ndjson happy-path, cursor StartAfter, empty list, malformed line skip, json-array, csv with 3 rows). Full Phase 10 unit suite: 27 passing. | 🅢 (`17dafb79e`) | ✓ |
| P10-reference-impl ✅ | `copilotStudio.puller.ts` — reference impl with LOCKED URL + auth + mapping (admins provide credentials only) hitting `/v1.0/auditLogs/directoryAudits`, 15-min default schedule. **Pattern other reference pullers must follow:** extend `HttpPollingPullerAdapter`, export locked `*_PULL_CONFIG` constant, override `validateConfig` to ignore caller overrides. | 🅢 (`3fdf6626b`) | ✓ |
| P10-openai-claude-references ✅ | Two more lock-the-shape reference impls extending the framework: **`OpenAiComplianceReferencePuller`** (S3-based) — customers BYO bucket + region + AWS creds; everything else (parser=`ndjson`, OpenAI audit_log mapping, 15-min schedule) is frozen. **`ClaudeComplianceReferencePuller`** (HTTP-based) — customers provide workspace API key only; URL=`api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/audit_log` + `x-api-key`/`anthropic-version` headers + audit-log mapping all locked. **Adapter id space is now 5**: `http_polling`, `s3_polling`, `copilot_studio`, `openai_compliance`, `claude_compliance` — admin UI source-type discovery picks all up via `pullerAdapterRegistry.ids()`. Lock-the-shape pattern documented in `38ccf82f0` commit body. | 🅢 (`38ccf82f0`) | |
| P10-worker ✅ | `pullerWorker.ts` — source-agnostic BullMQ worker: resolves adapter by id, runs once, persists cursor on success / increments errorCount on failure. **Event-sink wiring is currently a TODO log** (NormalizedPullEvent shape maps cleanly onto existing OCSF event sink, just needs the call-out wired in `pullerWorker.ts`). | 🅢 (`3fdf6626b`) | ✓ |
| P10-event-sink-wire ✅ | Replaced the TODO log in `pullerWorker.ts` with direct `GovernanceOcsfEventsClickHouseRepository.insertEvent` per `NormalizedPullEvent`. **Direct-to-CH (NOT via the trace pipeline)** — architectural call captured in commit body: pull events are atomic audit-log entries, not multi-span traces; synthesizing fake spans adds zero observability value; the SIEM reads the OCSF table, so that's the sink. **Idempotency**: `EventId = <sourceType>:<source_event_id>`, `traceId = pull:<eventId>`; both at-least-once paths (BullMQ replay + adapter retry) collapse via `ReplacingMergeTree(LastUpdatedAt) ORDER BY (TenantId, EventId)`. **Partial-failure mode**: per-event `try/catch` — a single bad row doesn't kill the batch (log + capture + leave cursor in place); cursor stays put so the next run re-pulls and the successful events re-insert idempotently. 17 puller unit tests passing (12 HttpPolling + 5 ocsfMapping). | 🅢 (`5c084ceca`) | ✓ |
| P10-schema ✅ | Migration `20260503030000`: `IngestionSource.errorCount` + `IngestionSource.pullSchedule`. (Existing `IngestionSource.pullConfig` / `lastCursor` / `lastPolledAt` columns landed in earlier governance schema work.) | 🅢 (`3fdf6626b`) | ✓ |
| P10-int-test ✅ | `pullerWorker.dispatch.test.ts` (6 scenarios) — worker-level coverage exercising the full dispatch path with **mocked storage edges only** (Prisma + CH client + `ssrfFetch`); **real** registry, **real** `adapter.runOnce` (HttpPollingPullerAdapter with stubbed fetch), **real** `mapToOcsfRow`. Same shape as the Docker-dependent integration test would have — testContainers swap is the only delta when Docker recovers. **Scenarios**: (1) Happy path: http_polling → 2 events → 2 OCSF rows + cursor advance + `awaiting_first_event → active` promotion; (2) Missing IngestionSource: bail without dispatch; (3) Disabled status: bail without dispatch; (4) Unknown adapter id: `errorCount++`; (5) 3× 503 exhausted: cursor preserved + `errorCount++`; (6) EventId composition: `<sourceType>:<source_event_id>` for ReplacingMergeTree dedup. **Phase 10 unit suite: 33 passing** (12 HttpPolling + 5 ocsfMapping + 10 S3Polling + 6 dispatch). Plus Phase 9 integration test (Docker-pending for full PG+CH flow). | 🅢 (`4cd210b33`) | ✓ |
| P10-spec ✅ | `specs/ai-governance/puller-framework/{puller-adapter-contract,http-polling,s3-polling,copilot-studio-reference}.feature` shipped (this commit) — 4 specs, 26 scenarios total: framework contract (interface shape + cursor-based pagination + restart-safety + bad-config rejection + adapter-errors-don't-crash-worker + canonical NormalizedEvent shape); http_polling (config validation, single + multi-page pulls, header template substitution, 5xx retry, 4xx fail-fast, missing-cursor handled); s3_polling (config validation, drain, cursor-based key resume, parser switching, malformed-file-skipped, credential rotation); copilot-studio reference (one-click admin enable, locked reference config, end-to-end fixture pull, cursor restart, 401 surfaced as actionable, future-puller pattern). | 🅐 (this commit) | |
| P10-ui ✅ | Pull-source composer at `/settings/governance/ingestion-sources` wired to PullerAdapter framework. **Surfaces 3 of 5 adapters** — the locked reference impls only (`copilot_studio`, `openai_compliance`, `claude_compliance`); the 2 BYO-config adapters (`http_polling`, `s3_polling`) are queued as a richer-form follow-up (orchestrator call 2026-05-03 — defer unless rchaves asks otherwise). Composer additions: `PULL_ADAPTER_FOR_SOURCE` map mirrors Sergey's adapter id space; `PULL_SCHEDULE_DEFAULTS` map mirrors locked `*_PULL_CONFIG.schedule` defaults; `ComposerState.pullSchedule: string` for admin override (placeholder shows the locked default); `onSubmit` auto-injects `pullConfig: { adapter: "<id>" }` + trims user-typed schedule (or falls back to default) when source-type is in the map; null/null for non-puller sources; new `<PullScheduleField />` component renders only for puller-mode source-types (mono-font input + BullMQ tick-semantics helper copy). Service+router updates: `CreateIngestionSourceInput` accepts `pullConfig` + `pullSchedule`, persisted with `Prisma.JsonNull` for explicit JSON-NULL. **Side-fix folded in (LSP):** widened `readonly id` on HttpPolling/S3Polling base classes from literal type to `string` so subclass overrides type-check (Sergey hit the same in `38ccf82f0`). | 🅑 (`0c9c0f166`) | |
| P10-docs ✅ (scaffold) | `docs/ai-governance/pull-mode-connectors.mdx` shipped (this commit) — full overview with ASCII pipeline diagram, two-universal-adapters table, http_polling + s3_polling config-shape examples (real JSON), normalized-event-shape table, write-a-custom-puller TS skeleton, reference-impl section explaining the Copilot Studio one-click pattern. Wired into `docs.json` AI Governance Operations group alongside `cli-debug`. Cross-links to `ingestion-sources/index.mdx` + `cli-debug` + `compliance-architecture.mdx`. | 🅐 (this commit) | |

### Phase 11 — CLI wrapper end-to-end tests in CI (NEW per rchaves directive 2026-05-03)

> **Concept (rchaves quote, condensed)**: For Claude / Codex / Cursor / Gemini / OpenCode wrappers (`langwatch claude` etc) — has the wrapper login been tested e2e? Dogfooded? Are there CI e2e tests to keep them working? Reuse anything from gateway AI work.
>

Pure-Node harness, **3-second total runtime**, no Docker, no live LLM. Stands up fake control-plane Express + fake gateway Express on random ports with in-memory fixtures + deterministic OpenAI/Anthropic-shape responses. Spawns the wrapper as a child process via async `spawn()` (NOT `spawnSync` — see §Phase 11 harness gotchas below). Tests against `envForTool()` seam at `typescript-sdk/src/cli/utils/governance/wrapper.ts:32-70`. **16/16 passing.** | 🅢 (`d7c59436d`) | ✓ |
| P11-per-wrapper ✅ | **All 5 tools landed in the same chunk** (cursor + gemini came along for free since the env-injection assertion shape was line-for-line identical — just two more rows in `describe.each`, no harness expansion). Coverage matrix: login-state-gating (claude, 1) + env-injection (claude/codex/opencode/cursor/gemini, 5) + routing-HTTP-to-fake-gateway-with-Bearer-VK (claude/codex/opencode, 3) + budget-pre-check 402/200/5xx (claude, 3) + tool-not-found (claude, 1) + exit-code-propagation claude(0,42) + codex(1) (3). opencode is treated like cursor (both Anthropic + OpenAI pairs injected, since opencode is multi-provider). | 🅢 (`d7c59436d`) | ✓ |
| P11-ci ✅ | New `test:governance-e2e` script wired in `typescript-sdk/package.json`; standalone `vitest.governance-e2e.config.mts`. **No Docker / no live LLM / no Bifrost matrix dependency** — runs as a normal Node test. CI workflow registration is a one-liner add to the existing typescript-sdk test job (or a new shard); harness shape is fully ready for that wire-in. | 🅢 (`d7c59436d`) | ✓ |
| P11-spec ✅ | `specs/ai-gateway/wrapper-e2e/{claude,codex,cursor,gemini,opencode}.feature` shipped (`bd4875f56`) — 5 specs, 27 scenarios total: per-wrapper env-var injection (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL / OPENAI_BASE_URL / GEMINI_API_KEY / OPENCODE_LLM_BASE_URL etc.), gateway routing + bearer = personal VK, trace attribution carries principal_id + organization_id + `personal: true`, budget-exhaustion graceful 429, 409 no_default_routing_policy surfaced via wrapper login, exit-code passthrough. claude/codex add the `gen_ai.system` correctness check; cursor adds the dual-shape (Anthropic-shaped + custom completion) handling; gemini adds Google's `usageMetadata` token-extraction; opencode adds multi-call workflow trace-tree continuity. | 🅐 (`bd4875f56`) | |

#### Phase 11 harness gotchas (captured for `dev/docs/best_practices/` follow-on)

Two non-obvious failure modes surfaced + solved while building the harness — both apply broadly to any future "spawn the compiled CLI as a child + assert against in-process fakes" pattern in this repo:

1. **vitest threads-pool deadlock with in-process HTTP servers.** Default `pool: "threads"` + `spawnSync` blocks the worker's event loop, so a fake control-plane / fake gateway hosted in the SAME worker can't accept the spawned child's `fetch` — the child waits forever and `spawnSync` hits its timeout. **Fix**: `pool: "forks"` (singleFork) + async `spawn()` returning a Promise, so the worker's loop stays free to serve HTTP while the child runs. **Reproduction**: a 3-line vitest test with `spawnSync("node", ["-e", "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:PORT')"])` against a `http.createServer` in the same `beforeAll` deadlocks; identical setup with async `spawn` does not.

2. **PATH leakage in tool-not-found scenarios.** Dev machines have `claude` / `codex` / `cursor` / `gemini` / `opencode` installed at `~/.local/bin` / `~/.nvm/.../bin` / `/usr/local/bin`. Inheriting parent PATH means `spawn(tool)` succeeds with the REAL binary instead of triggering ENOENT — the wrapper's "binary not found → exit 127" path never fires, the real claude CLI runs and exits with its own code (1, "missing prompt"), test asserts wrong outcome. **Fix**: when `includeToolStubs: false`, scrub PATH to just `/usr/bin:/bin` + use `process.execPath` for the node binary (absolute path) so we don't need node-version-manager dirs on PATH.

### Phase 3 — Tamper-evidence + SIEM push (post-GA, named follow-ups)

| | Owner | Task |
|---|---|---|
| 📋 | 🅢 | Cryptographic Merkle-root publication of `event_log` digests |
| 📋 | 🅢 | Customer-rotatable signing keys + verification REST API |
| 📋 | 🅢 | Per-org SIEM push management UI (Splunk HEC / Datadog / Sentinel) |
| 📋 | 🅢 | DLQ + replay infrastructure for failed SIEM pushes |
| 📋 | 🅢 | Tamper-evidence verification UI |

### Critical path to "ship the governance pitch"

The narrowest demo-able slice is now mostly done. Remaining for closed-loop merge:

1. **Step 3b/3c/3d/3e/3f** (Sergey, ~3–5 days): folds + retention TTL + OCSF read API + anomaly reactor rewire
2. **Phase 4 license relocation + UI gating** (cross-lane, ~2–3 days)
3. **Live-data dogfood pass** (Alexis, ~half day post-3a) — proof-quality screenshots replacing iter22 $0/0
4. **Customer-facing docs flip** (Andre, ~half day post-3b/3c)
5. **Volume regression + cross-org concurrency tests** (Sergey, ~half day) — pre-GA gate
6. **End-to-end smoke test in CI** (cross-lane, ~half day)

Total to closed loop: **~5–8 working days** with 3 lanes in parallel.

## Personal-Key Journey — Jane at Acme storyboard + persona-aware home

> Per rchaves directive 2026-04-29: the Jane at Acme 8-screen storyboard from `gateway.md` is the **trial-wedge demo loop** — the apache2-floor experience that closes enterprise sales bottom-up. It was missing as an explicit deliverable until this section. Cross-lane sources: lane-A audit (Andre, kanban) + lane-B UI inventory delta (Alexis at `.monitor-logs/lane-b-jane-storyboard-ui-delta.md`) + lane-S backend audit (Sergey, kanban). Atomic tasks are tracked in **§Phase 1B.5** of the Gantt above.

### The 8-screen storyboard (from gateway.md)

A senior engineer (Jane) at a fictional enterprise customer (Acme) joins the company. IT pings her in Slack. By the end of the day she's productive in Claude Code with org-attributed spend, a personal monthly budget set by her admin, no manual provider config, and a personal usage dashboard.

| Screen | Storyboard intent |
|---|---|
| 0 | Slack message from IT bot: "Welcome Jane! Install LangWatch: `curl -sSL get.langwatch.com \| sh`" |
| 1 | Terminal: `langwatch login` opens browser at `app.langwatch.com/cli/<code>` |
| 2 | Browser: focused single-input "Sign in to LangWatch" with email autodetect → routes to org SSO |
| 3 | Company SSO bounce (Okta/SAML — LangWatch is just the kicker) |
| 4 | Browser: "You're signed in!" + close-tab CTA. Terminal: prints `✓ Logged in as jane@acme.com` + inherited providers (anthropic / openai / gemini) + monthly budget (`$500`, used `$0`) + try-it commands |
| 5 | `langwatch claude` opens Claude Code transparently routed through the gateway with Jane's personal VK |
| 6 | `/me` personal dashboard: 3-card KPI top (spend / requests / most-used model) + spending-over-time chart + by-tool stacked bars + recent-activity row list. WorkspaceSwitcher (Personal / Team / Project flip) at top-left |
| 7 | `/me/settings`: profile (managed by IT) + Personal API Keys per-device with Revoke + Notifications panel + Budget read-only ("$500 / month — set by your Acme admin · cannot edit") |
| 8 | Budget-limit reached: `langwatch claude` prints `⚠ Budget limit reached — ask your team admin to raise your limit`. Admin contact + `langwatch request-increase` command |

### Per-screen current-vs-target audit (Alexis)

| Screen | Today | Bucket | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | get.langwatch.com installer queued in Phase 1A; no desktop app | 🔴 Net-new | 🅐 (CLI distro) |
| 1 | `langwatch login --device` shipped + `pages/auth/cli/[code].tsx` exists | 🟢 Wireable | 🅑 (screenshot) |
| 2 | `/signin` shows full provider list — not the focused single-input variant | 🟡 Polish | 🅑 (`/signin-cli`) |
| 3 | Existing `/api/auth` flow handles SAML/OIDC for SSO-configured orgs | 🟢 Wireable | 🅑 (screenshot) |
| 4 | Bounce-back to generic success page; no provider+budget ceremony; CLI does not enumerate inherited providers/budget | 🟡 Polish (web) + 🔴 Net-new (CLI) | 🅑 (web) + 🅐 (CLI print) |
| 5 | typescript-sdk wrapper shipped | ✅ Shipped | — |
| 6 | `/me` exists with `<MyUsageDashboard>` (sparkline + budget meter); missing 3-card top + by-tool stacked bars + recent-activity rows | 🟡 Polish | 🅑 (layout refresh) |
| 7 | `/me/settings` exists (PAT list + budget readonly); missing per-device labels + notifications panel + "managed by your company" chrome | 🟡 Polish + small Net-new | 🅑 |
| 8 | Web-side `BudgetExceededBanner` shipped (iter5); CLI doesn't render formatted budget-limit-reached message | 🟡 Polish (web) + 🔴 Net-new (CLI) | 🅑 (web) + 🅐 (CLI rendering) |

**Summary**: 1 ✅ shipped, 2 🟢 wireable today (screenshot achievable), 4 🟡 polish/redesign, 3 🔴 net-new (mostly lane-A CLI surfaces). The polish slice fits inside Phase 1B; full demo-loop dogfood is achievable post-1.5b-x.

**Backend audit (Sergey)**: backend is essentially fully built for the Jane journey. `personalUsage.service.ts` exposes `summary` / `dailyBuckets` / `breakdownByModel` / `recentActivity` (matches Screen 6 layout exactly). `personalVirtualKey.service.ts` handles per-device + revoke (Screen 7). Budget-exceeded wire shape locked: HTTP 402 + JSON `{type: 'budget_exceeded', message, scope, ...}` at `auth-cli.ts:701` + `user.ts:460` (consumed today by web `BudgetExceededBanner` via `usePersonalContext.ts:38`; CLI rendering is the lane-A polish). Only 1 missing backend signal: `setupState.hasApplicationTraces` (1.5s, Sergey, ~30min). Resolver should run in `getServerSideProps` on `pages/index.tsx` (deterministic, avoids client-side flash) and fail-safe to `/[firstProject]/messages` on any signal-lookup error.

**Iter27 dogfood discovery (Alexis)**: `/me` + `/me/settings` are already production-ready against the storyboard layout. 1.5b-iv (`/me` layout refresh) + 1.5b-v (`/me/settings` polish) drop from "biggest slice" to ~0.3 iters each — minor polish only. Live screenshots below.

### Live-data screenshots (iter27, Alexis 1.5b-i)

These supersede the iter22 shots that were limited by the pre-3a `$0/0` empty-state. Captured against `pnpm dev :5570` post-Sergey 3a (`fd118131c`) + 1.5b-viii persona resolver (`e40ee0045`).

**Screen 6 — `/me` personal dashboard** (Storyboard layout match: STRONG; refreshed iter33 capture post-persona-aware-chrome rework — single-chip header, PersonalSidebar, no LLMOps double-menu): 3-card top strip (`SPENT THIS MONTH $0.00` / `REQUESTS THIS MONTH 0` / `MOST-USED MODEL —`) + Spending over time chart placeholder + By tool placeholder + Recent activity ("Run `langwatch claude` to get started" empty-state) + WorkspaceSwitcher dropdown header. → grid cell **Persona-1 / `/me` portal**.

**Screen 7 — `/me/settings`** (Storyboard layout match: STRONG; refreshed iter32 capture post-persona-aware-chrome rework — single-chip header + PersonalSidebar; supersedes the iter27 shot which still rendered the old LLMOps double-menu): Profile section with `Managed by test IT` subtitle on email row + Personal API Keys section ("No personal keys yet") + Notifications panel (3 checkboxes for 80% / weekly summary / per-request threshold) + Budget section ("No personal budget set by your admin"). The "managed by your company" chrome is already in place. → grid cell **Persona-1 / `/me` portal** (settings sub-state).

**Screen 1 — `/cli/auth?user_code=...` browser handshake**: "Authorize the LangWatch CLI" + monospace user code + "Confirm this matches the code in your terminal" + Approve / Deny. The browser side of `langwatch login --device`. → grid cell **Persona-1 / Onboarding** (CLI handoff).

**Screen 4 — `/cli/auth` web-side success ceremony** (the apache2-floor demo wedge proof): "Authorize the LangWatch CLI" header + green-tick "You're signed in!" message + "LangWatch CLI is now authorized for **<org>** using the `default` personal key. You can close this tab and return to your terminal." Jane's first "I'm in" moment captured live; issued personal VK carries the org-default `RoutingPolicy`. → grid cell **Persona-1 / Onboarding** (CLI handoff success).

**Negative-case — approval-failed when org has no provider configured** (caught + fixed inline): the dogfood pass surfaced a real UX bug — when an admin tries to approve the device-flow before configuring a ModelProvider, the page returned a generic "Failed to issue key" with no action. **Inline fix shipped in `915d8def3`** updates the message to "Your admin needs to configure a model provider first. Ask them to add one at Settings → Model Providers." → grid cell **Persona-4 / Error state** (capture targets BEFORE-state for the regression-pin).

> **Visual evidence**: all five frames live in §Screenshots above; iter32-iter33 captures from `dev/dogfood-screenshots/iter32-iter33/` (iter33-p1-me-final2.png, iter32-me-settings.png — survive branch state); iter27 CLI-handshake captures were on `i.img402.dev` 7-day CDN and have expired — re-capture queued under `docs/images/ai-governance/persona-x-flow/dev/cli-handoff/` per Lane-B's centralized scheme.

**iter28 discoveries** (Alexis post-screenshot pass):

1. **Device-flow happy path is end-to-end functional once provider + default RoutingPolicy are configured.** Setup sequence (committable as a follow-up dogfood utility): `ModelProvider` (scope=ORGANIZATION) → default `RoutingPolicy` (scope=organization, isDefault=true, providerCredentialIds=[modelProvider.id], modelAllowlist=[...]) → device-flow approve succeeds. Without the default RoutingPolicy, `PersonalVirtualKeyService.issue` → `VirtualKeyService.create` → `assertProviderCredentialsBelongToProject` fails with "At least one provider credential is required" — this is the failure path captured in the BEFORE screenshot above.

2. **`RoutingPolicy.scope` case-sensitivity bug found**: seed wrote `scope='ORGANIZATION'` (uppercase) but `routingPolicy.service.ts:resolveDefaultForUser` queries `scope='organization'` (lowercase). Subtle data-shape inconsistency. Tracked as a follow-up bug-fix; one-shot migration utility at `langwatch/scripts/dogfood/fix-policy-scope.ts` is committable.

3. **CLI terminal-side captures (Screens 1 / 4 / 5 / 8) require additional setup**:
   - Screens 1 + 4 (CLI prints) need `langwatch login --device` against a fully-configured org (provider + default policy + Bearer token persistence)
   - Screen 5 (`langwatch claude` running) requires Claude Code installed locally + actual gateway-routed LLM call — out of scope for headless Playwright. Will be captured via image-stitching from CLI text output in a code block in the customer-facing docs.
   - Screen 8 (budget-exceeded terminal) requires hitting the actual budget cap (token-counting + cost-rounding + budget-debit timing).

Populated `/me` + `/me/settings` recapture (with personal-VK row + actual usage data) is pending the hot-reload settle on the iter28 dev server. Will update this section when those land.

### Persona-aware home — resolver, not page (Alexis)

rchaves's 4-persona model:

| Persona | Trigger | Default home |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Personal-only (just CLI users) | Has personal VK + zero project memberships | `/me` |
| 2 — Personal + Project (mixed) | Has personal VK + ≥1 project membership | `/me` (with "Switch to project view" CTA inline; WorkspaceSwitcher fallback) |
| 3 — **Project-only LLMOps (CURRENT default — most existing customers)** | No personal VK + ≥1 project membership | `/[firstProject]/messages` (today's behavior — must NOT change) |
| 4 — Super-admin governance | Org has governance ingest AND user has organizationManage permission AND plan = enterprise | `/governance` |

**Decision: route resolver, not a new `/home` page.** Server-side redirect at `pages/index.tsx` `getServerSideProps` consuming `api.governance.setupState` (already exposed in iter15) + role bindings + plan tier. New `personaResolver.service.ts` (~80 LOC) plus a tRPC procedure that returns the resolved path. Override mechanism: persist user's last-visited home in user settings so explicit navigation sticks across sessions.

**Critical constraint (rchaves)**: most current LangWatch users are LLMOps admins NOT in any AI Gateway flow. Persona-3 (project-only) MUST stay on `/[project]/messages` exactly as today. Locked as a regression test in 1.5b-viii: org with no governance + no personal VKs + with projects → resolver returns `/[firstProject]/messages`. Sergey's `setupState.hasApplicationTraces` flag (1.5s) is the substrate signal for this default-detection.

**Detection logic** (proposed at `langwatch/src/server/governance/personaResolver.service.ts` — Alexis):

```typescript
function resolvePersonaHome({ user, organizationId, setupState, plan }) {
  // Persona 4 — super-admin governance (combo guard prevents
  // accidental /governance default for LLMOps-only admins)
  if (
    setupState.hasGovernanceIngest &&
    user.hasOrganizationManagePermission &&
    plan.isEnterprise
  ) return "/governance";

  // Persona 1 — personal-only
  if (setupState.hasPersonalVirtualKey && user.projectMemberships.length === 0)
    return "/me";

  // Persona 2 — mixed (defaults to /me; WorkspaceSwitcher flips to project)
  if (setupState.hasPersonalVirtualKey && user.projectMemberships.length > 0)
    return "/me";

  // Persona 3 — project-only LLMOps (DEFAULT for current customers)
  return defaultProjectHome(user); // typically /[firstProject]/messages
}
```

### Atomic-task split (also tracked in §Phase 1B.5 of the Gantt)

**Lane-B (Alexis)** — 10 atomic UI tasks, ~6 iters:
1.5b-i screenshots Screens 1/3/5 · 1.5b-ii Screen 2 single-input email variant · 1.5b-iii Screen 4 "You're in!" ceremony · 1.5b-iv Screen 6 /me layout refresh (biggest slice) · 1.5b-v Screen 7 /me/settings polish · 1.5b-vi Screen 8 BudgetExceededBanner enrichment · 1.5b-vii WorkspaceSwitcher v2 · 1.5b-viii Persona resolver service + / redirect + tRPC + regression test (~300 LOC + migration) · 1.5b-ix BDD spec `persona-home-resolver.feature` · 1.5b-x Live-data Playwright dogfood capturing all 8 screens

**Lane-S (Sergey)** — 1 atomic backend task:
1.5s `setupState.hasApplicationTraces` flag for persona-3 default-detection (1-method addition, no schema change)

**Lane-A (Andre)** — 4 atomic tasks (CLI + docs):
1.5a-cli-1 CLI Screen 4 provider+budget enumeration on login completion · 1.5a-cli-2 CLI Screen 8 budget-limit message + `langwatch request-increase` · 1.5a-docs `docs/getting-started/personal-ide-keys.mdx` storyboard walkthrough + Slack onboarding template · 1.5a-marketing open-core marketing-page outline

### Deferred decisions for rchaves (3 votes)

- **Vote G — Phase 1B.5 sequencing**: parallel with Phase 4 (license relocation), or sequential (1B.5 first, then Phase 4)? Lane-B + Lane-S vote **parallel** (zero merge-conflict surface; 1B.5 touches `/me`, `/me/settings`, persona resolver; Phase 4 touches `ee/governance/*` relocation). Need rchaves's call.
- **Vote H — In-this-PR vs follow-up PR**: ship 1B.5 inside `feat/governance-platform`, or as a separate follow-up PR? Lane-B votes **SPLIT**: block this PR on the demo-loop critical path (1.5b-i + ii + iii + iv + v + viii + 1.5s + 1.5a-cli-1 + 1.5a-cli-2); follow-up PR for polish (1.5b-vi + vii + ix + x + 1.5a-docs + 1.5a-marketing). Lane-A leans the same; lane-S agnostic. Need rchaves's call.
- **Vote I — Rollout shape**: feature-flagged gradual rollout (e.g. `release_persona_home_resolver_default_on`) vs default-on launch? Lane-B + Lane-S vote **feature flag** — default-on for orgs created post-merge, default-off for existing orgs with explicit `/me/settings` opt-in. Locks the LLMOps-customer-majority safety. Need rchaves's call.

## PM round-up — what's missing for production polish

Cross-lane sources: lane-A (Andre), lane-B (Alexis at `.monitor-logs/lane-b-license-split-input.md` §5+§7), lane-S (Sergey backend gaps).

### Customer-facing flow gaps

1. **No first-time-admin tour.** A CTO landing on `/governance` for the first time gets the layout but no walkthrough. Needs a 3-step guided overlay: "1. Add a source 2. Send a test event 3. Watch it appear in your dashboard."
2. **No "fire test event" button.** SecretModal shows a curl example but no in-product affordance to close the verify loop in 60 seconds.
3. **No source-health degradation alert.** A source that goes silent for 24h stays "Active" until the rolling window flips. Should fire an internal anomaly: "ingestion-source went silent."
4. **Onboarding checklist deep-nested.** First-source-mint is 3 clicks (Settings → Governance → Ingestion Sources → +Add). Collapse to single empty-state CTA on `/governance`.
5. **Workspace switcher v2 (Alexis)**: Personal vs Team visual + chrome context indicator.
6. **CLI↔Web bridge (Alexis)**: session URL print on `langwatch login` + OTel resource stamp + `langwatch dashboard` cmd.
7. **No spend forecasting.** Dashboard shows current 7d/30d spend but nothing predicts "you'll hit your budget cap on day 23 of this month at current burn." High-value low-cost addition once ActivityMonitorService has the data.

### UX polish gaps

8. **Empty-state mid-state (Sergey)**: when source exists but no spans flowing → $0/0 with no diagnostic. Need "Source minted X minutes ago — first event expected within Y" hint.
9. **Source detail page lacks rate-over-time sparkline (Sergey)**. Would help diagnose drops.
10. **WorkspaceSwitcher Layer-1 invariant invisible to support staff (Sergey)**. `?show_internal=1` debug flag for triaging "missing project" reports.
11. **CLI ingest commands gated behind `LANGWATCH_GOVERNANCE_PREVIEW=1` env var** — drop the gate when the feature is real; until then docs should call this out.
12. **OTLP body shape varies subtly per source-type** — per-platform docs need a "Beyond minimum" section per source for vendor-specific attributes.
13. **AnomalyRule composer drawer width is `lg` — cramped for descriptions**. Lane-B follow-up.

### Backend production-quality gaps (Sergey)

14. **Volume regression missing** — receiver rewire passed 13 unit-shape tests but no `1000 spans/sec for 60s`. Hidden-Gov-Project lazy-ensure does `prisma.findFirst` on EVERY request — needs cache.
15. **Cross-org concurrency** — Andre's helper has 5-concurrent test for ONE org. Missing: 50 orgs × 100 concurrent first-mints. The slug-based collision check at `governanceProject.service.ts:82` is the linchpin under that load.
16. **Reactor backpressure** — when 3b/3e land, anomaly reactor + governance_kpis fold + trace-summary fold all share the trace-processing pipeline. Need load test to verify priority ordering.
17. **CH retention TTL atomicity** — when 3c lands, retention is attribute-keyed. If a span lands without the attribute (bug), it defaults to 30d → wrong tier for `seven_years` sources. Need TTL-mismatch alarm.
18. **Receiver auth rate limiting** — `/api/ingest/{otel,webhook}/:sourceId` is unbounded. Leaked source secret = firehose. Need per-source Redis-token-bucket RPS limit.
19. **OCSF schema versioning** — when 3d lands, v1.1 cooked into the fold. v1.2 is in draft. Need `OcsfSchemaVersion` column for graceful upgrade.

### Dogfood gaps

20. **Live-data dashboard screenshot for the PR doc** — iter22 shows $0/0 (pre-3a stub). Post-3a, Alexis re-runs the dogfood script and replaces shot #1 with a real-numbers version.
21. **End-to-end smoke test in CI** — no CI job currently does the full mint-org → mint-source → POST OTLP → assert-dashboard-shows-it loop.
22. **Cross-org isolation smoke at HTTP receiver** — tested in store + helper layers but not at the HTTP receiver layer with full request from org-A and verification org-B doesn't see anything.
23. **No load test / performance assertion** — pre-GA blocker for enterprise sales calls.
24. **Live `langwatch claude` dogfood GIF for the README/marketing** (Alexis §7).
25. **No demo-data seed for fresh installs (Alexis §7)** — first-run-experience without dogfood is a $0/0 dashboard.

### Testing gaps

26. **No spec-driven tests yet** — 8 BDD specs describe scenarios; each scenario is implicitly proven by an integration test in another file. Could harden into explicit BDD test runs (probably defer to post-GA).
27. **No license-split assertion test** — once relocation lands, defensive test in `ee/governance/__tests__/` that asserts non-enterprise org cannot reach `/api/ingest/*` regardless of valid Bearer.
28. **No tamper-evidence spec test skeleton** — follow-up contract is named in `compliance-baseline.feature` but no skip-but-named scenarios. Pre-shipping the design.
29. **Anomaly reactor needs idempotency test** — schema-level constraint exists; reactor itself untested under retry.
30. **No real-world wire-shape fixtures (Sergey)** for non-OTel sources (workato/s3_custom/copilot_studio webhook bodies).

### Documentation gaps

31. **No `dev/docs/architecture/` rollup** of the unified-substrate decision. ADR-018 captures it but no engineering-onboarding-friendly diagram + flow doc.
32. **No customer-facing migration story** for existing self-hosters from BSL → Apache 2.0 + ee/. What happens to their governance data on upgrade? Do they need a new license key?
33. **No `LICENSE-EE` reviewable text** — blocker for licensing pivot.
34. **No marketing-page outline for the open-core split** — public-facing pricing page.
35. **`ee/` license-header CI check (Alexis §7)** — defensive regression against accidental file moves.

### Deferred decisions for rchaves resolution

- **Vote D** (license): Personal-key SSO (SCIM auto-provisioning of personal teams + policies) — apache2 vs `ee/`? Lane-A and lane-B lean apache2 (basic SAML in CE per GitLab precedent); SCIM/group-sync in EE. Need rchaves's call.
- **Vote F** (license-flip timing): BSL → Apache 2.0 license-flip — same PR as governance ee/ relocation, or separate prep PR landing first? Need rchaves's call.
- **Vote G** (Phase 1B.5 sequencing — see § Personal-Key Journey): parallel with Phase 4 (license relocation), or sequential (1B.5 first, then Phase 4)? Lane-B + Lane-S vote **parallel** (zero merge-conflict surface). Need rchaves's call.
- **Vote H** (in-this-PR vs follow-up): ship Phase 1B.5 inside `feat/governance-platform`, or as a separate follow-up PR? Lane-B votes **SPLIT**: block this PR on the demo-loop critical path (1.5b-i+ii+iii+iv+v+viii + 1.5s + 1.5a-cli-1+2); follow-up PR for polish (1.5b-vi+vii+ix+x + 1.5a-docs + 1.5a-marketing). Lane-A leans the same; lane-S agnostic. Need rchaves's call.
- **Vote I** (rollout shape): feature-flagged gradual rollout (e.g. `release_persona_home_resolver_default_on`) vs default-on launch for the persona-aware `/` redirect? Lane-B + Lane-S vote **feature flag** — default-on for orgs created post-merge, default-off for existing orgs with explicit `/me/settings` opt-in. Locks the LLMOps-customer-majority safety. Need rchaves's call.

### Top 5 PM-hat recommendations (consolidated)

1. **Land step 3b/3c (folds + retention TTL) before doing the ee/ relocation.** Folds are new code; relocating new code immediately is fine. Retention TTL is the compliance pricing axis; lock it before moving.
2. **Do the ee/ relocation as 3 commits, one per lane** (4a-1 backend; 4a-2 backend; 4a-3 UI), so each lane reviews their slice independently. No big-bang refactor.
3. **Block the merge on the live-data dogfood pass** (Alexis post-3a) and the end-to-end smoke test in CI (cross-lane). Without these the PR is shippable in form but not in confidence.
4. **Defer tamper-evidence + revocation-automation completely** to a follow-up PR. Naming them as filed-not-shipped (already done in spec) is enough.
5. **Add license-gate assertion test (4c-1)** as a hard gate before merge — defensive correctness against future license-bypass regressions.

---

- **Cryptographic tamper-evidence** (Merkle root publication + signing keys
  + verification REST API): filed-not-shipped. Hardening layer for the
  regulated-industry segment (SEC 17a-4 / HITECH strict / EU AI Act high-risk).
  Append-only `event_log` covers SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 / EU AI Act baseline /
  GDPR / HIPAA-most-uses without it.
- **Heavyweight SIEM PUSH infrastructure** (DLQ + per-org webhook UI + replay):
  filed-not-shipped. The OCSF read projection + lightweight cursor-pull cron
  pattern covers the common case.
- **Per-platform deeper webhook adapters** (workato job-array unwrapping,
  S3 DSL parsing, Copilot Studio Purview event shapes, OpenAI/Claude
  compliance JSONL pullers): the default
  `buildWebhookLogRequest` ships as the body=raw-JSON one-event-per-envelope
  fallback. Per-platform adapters land per-source as follow-up PRs that
  REPLACE the default mapper but keep the same handoff.
- **Org plan ceiling enforcement on retention class**: composer offers all
  three options; plan-side validation lands when billing config exposes the
  per-org retention ceiling.

---

## Notes for reviewers

- The architecture pivoted mid-branch (rchaves directive + master_orchestrator
  ratification 2026-04-27). The mechanical delete commit `f3de1ae07` is the
  boundary; pre-pivot commits are preserved for audit but the architecture
  they reflect is no longer the target.
- Three lanes (backend / docs / UI) coordinate via the `kanban` channel;
  cross-lane decisions are surfaced in the same channel before code lands.
- The full discussion that produced the architecture lock (5 rounds of
  pushback / refinement / consolidation) is in the kanban channel history.
  This document captures the LOCKED architecture; the discussion is not
  re-litigated here.
