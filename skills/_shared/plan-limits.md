LangWatch's free plan has limits on prompts, scenarios, evaluators, experiments, and datasets. When you hit a limit, the API returns `"Free plan limit of N reached..."` with an upgrade link.

How to handle:

- Work within the limits — if 3 scenarios are allowed, create 3 meaningful ones, not 10.
- Make every creation count: each one should demonstrate clear value.
- Show what works FIRST. If you hit a limit, summarize what was accomplished and direct the user to upgrade at https://app.langwatch.ai/settings/subscription.
- Do NOT delete existing resources to make room, and do NOT reuse a scenario set to cram in more tests.

If `LANGWATCH_ENDPOINT` is set in `.env`, the user is self-hosted — direct them to `{LANGWATCH_ENDPOINT}/settings/license` instead
