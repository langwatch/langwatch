# LangWatch 🏰 MCP Server

The LangWatch MCP Server is a tool designed to aid finding, searching, and looking up Traces from the LangWatch platform via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

This server facilitates communication with LangWatch's API, allowing you to retrieve and manage LLM traces.

## Setup in Cursor 👩‍💻

2. Navigate to the MCP item in the sidebar
3. Set the "name" as "LangWatch MCP"
4. Set the "type" to `command`

> [!TIP]
> By default the environment variable `LANGWATCH_API_KEY` and `LANGWATCH_ENDPOINT` are pulled into the project. If that isn't an option for you, you can also use arguments in the command inside Cursor.

- `--apiKey`: Your LangWatch API key. This is mandatory and must be provided.
- `--endpoint`: The endpoint for the LangWatch API. Defaults to `https://app.langwatch.ai` if not specified.
