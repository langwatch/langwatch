# ADR-027: Per-organization stored-GiB-hours billing to Stripe via global event-sourced projection

**Date:** 2026-06-11

**Status:** Proposed

> One-line: bill **GiB-hours of stored bytes aged beyond the 30-day included window**, sampled per **sealed UTC hour** by a **global event-sourced projection**, reported additively to a **`sum`-formula Stripe meter**. Ingestion (flow) billing is explicitly rejected. No "current DB" snapshots — each sealed-window ClickHouse query is anchored to a past hour, not `now()`.

## Context

[ADR-022](./022-data-retention.md) enforces per-tenant retention with `_retention_days` and `_size_bytes` stamped at ingest and ClickHouse-native TTL doing deletion. That decides *what we delete and when*. It does not decide *what we charge for keeping data alive*. This ADR decides the billing axis.

The commercial model being encoded: **every paid plan includes 30 days of data retention for free; custom retention (60/90/180/custom) is the paid feature, billed at €3/GiB-month for bytes that live beyond 30 days.** The allowance is time-based (each byte's first 30 days are free), never volume-based — there is no "first N GiB free".

Forces shaping the design:

1. **Deletion must lower the bill by construction.** If we report X GB and retention later deletes Y, the invoice cannot leave the customer wondering whether they paid for X or X−Y. The model has to answer that with no rebate logic and no dispute surface. Industry converged on time-weighted GiB-hours for exactly this reason (AWS S3, GCS, R2, Snowflake, OpenObserve).

2. **Incremental reporting, not end-of-period.** A single monthly report is fragile: it can fail, and data arriving (or deleted) one minute before period close distorts it. Continuous hourly accrual makes every hour independently correct and independently retryable. All billing logic lives on our side; Stripe only ever receives "org X, hour H, N MiB".

3. **We already run a meter → Stripe pipeline.** `langwatch_billable_events` ships today: event-sourced `billing-reporting` pipeline (`src/server/event-sourcing/pipelines/billing-reporting/`), two-phase checkpoint with circuit-breaker, idempotent identifiers, SaaS gate. `StripeUsageReportingService` (`ee/billing/services/usageReportingService.ts`) speaks the modern `stripe.billing.meterEvents.create` API. Building parallel infrastructure would be wasted.

4. **We already measure stored bytes.** `StorageMeterService` (`src/server/data-retention/metering/storageMeter.service.ts`) returns `sum(_size_bytes)` across the 11 retention-managed tables per `TenantId`. The `_size_bytes` MATERIALIZED column landed in migration 00032.

5. **Multi-instance + zero customer disruption.** LangWatch runs N k8s replicas; the dispatcher must be single-processing across pods (inherited from the event-sourcing dispatch model, [ADR-007](./007-event-sourcing-architecture.md)). Rollout must not require re-checkout, change the `subscription_id`, or alter the billing cycle.

6. **Real customer base at go-live.** ~100 existing customers carry retention policies of 45/90/180 days — i.e. real beyond-30-day data exists the moment metering starts. Enterprises may run different retention policies per project within one organization (e.g. 4 months / 1 year / 5 years).

## Decision

We will bill **per-organization stored-bytes-aged-beyond-30-days, integrated over hourly sealed windows, summed across the billing period, in binary GiB at €3/GiB-month using a 30-day-month convention**. One Stripe meter event per organization per sealed UTC hour, value sent additively (`reportUsageDelta`) into a new `STORAGE_GB` meter with `default_aggregation.formula = "sum"`.

The hourly cadence + sum aggregation produces a true GiB-hours integral: period total ÷ 24 = GiB-days, ÷ 720 = GiB-months. The Stripe Price encodes the conversion at €3 / 30 / 24 / 1024 per MiB-hour.

Six load-bearing choices:

### 1. Measurement: sealed-window ClickHouse query, anchored to the sealed hour

For sealed hour H, the projection queries per managed table:

```sql
SELECT sum(_size_bytes)
FROM <managed_table>
WHERE TenantId IN (<projects of org>)
  AND <retentionCol> <= dateSub(HOUR, 30 * 24, toDateTime(H))
```

The cutoff is anchored to **H**, not `now()`. For a same-hour sample the two are equivalent; for a catch-up sample of a past hour they differ by the gap, and the H-anchor makes the measurement consistent with what a same-hour sampler would have captured (modulo TTL-eviction of far-edge rows in large gaps).

`_retention_days` plays **no role in the predicate** — we measure row age, not the customer's configured TTL. A custom-retention customer's billable surface is exactly "rows still present that are older than 30 days". This also handles per-project retention diversity within one org for free: the org bill is the sum across its projects, and a 5-year-retention project simply contributes more old rows than a 4-month one. One meter, one invoice line, naturally weighted.

### 2. Granularity: sealed UTC hour

`H = floor(eventTimestamp, HOUR)` in UTC. The projection's per-org cursor advances when an incoming event's hour crosses the stored boundary; a gap-fill loop emits one measurement per missing sealed hour, bounded by `STORAGE_BACKFILL_MAX_HOURS = 840` (35 days, Stripe's `timestamp` ceiling).

Hourly (vs daily) costs 24× the meter-event volume — negligible against Stripe's 1,000 events/sec limit — and ~720 audit rows/org/month in Postgres. It buys within-day fidelity: a write-then-delete inside one day still accrues the hours it lived, where daily sampling would miss it entirely.

### 3. Dispatcher: global event-sourced projection — no cron, no leader lock

Clone-pattern of `billingMeterDispatch.reactor.ts`. State: in-memory `Map<orgId, lastSealedHour>`, rehydrated from `StorageUsageHourly` on projection start. On every event with an orgId attribution:

```
eventHour = floor(event.timestamp, HOUR)  // UTC
last = state[orgId] ?? earliest unreported hour from StorageUsageHourly
if eventHour > last:
   for h in (last+1 .. eventHour-1):           // inclusive of gaps
      bytes_h = getBillableStorageBytesForOrgAt(orgId, sealedHour=h)
      megabytes = ceil(bytes_h / 1_048_576)
      INSERT StorageUsageHourly(orgId, sealedHour=h, megabytes)
         ON CONFLICT (orgId, sealedHour) DO NOTHING
      enqueue ReportStorageForHourCommand(orgId, h, megabytes)
   state[orgId] = eventHour
```

Cross-pod single-processing is inherited from the event-sourcing dispatch — no Redis lock, no interval constants. One operational model for the billable-events and storage meters.

The projection short-circuits for orgs that are not SaaS-billable (no `stripeCustomerId` / no active subscription / no `STORAGE_GB` SubscriptionItem) — those orgs generate zero queries, zero rows, zero Stripe calls.

### 4. Reporting command: `ReportStorageForHourCommand` (two-phase, idempotent)

Clones `reportUsageForMonth.command.ts`:

```
1. Mark in-flight on BillingMeterCheckpoint(orgId, meterName="STORAGE_GB", billingMonth=monthOf(h))
2. usageReportingService.reportUsageDelta({ events: [{
     eventName: "langwatch_storage_megabytes_hourly",
     value: row.megabytes,                       // additive, integer MiB
     timestamp: utcStartOf(row.sealedHour),
     identifier: `storage_mb:${orgId}:${isoHour(row.sealedHour)}`,
   }] })
3. UPDATE StorageUsageHourly SET reportedAt = now() WHERE orgId AND sealedHour
4. Confirm checkpoint
```

Period total on the Stripe side = Σ `megabytes` = MiB-hours. The additive-delta shape is load-bearing: `reportUsageSet` (current − previously-reported) telescopes to the *final* value on a `sum` meter — a last-value gauge in disguise, gameable by deleting on day 29. The raw hourly value sent additively is the integral; deletion lowers the *next* hour's contribution, never an already-billed one.

### 5. Customer matrix

| Customer | Custom retention | Retention reality | SubscriptionItem | Bill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS Free** | ✗ | 14-day visibility window; data held 45 days blurred as an upgrade-to-recover window (#4745) | **None — not attached** | €0; projection skips entirely |
| **SaaS Paid** | ✓ (30d included; opt into 60/90/…) | Retention setting controls deletion | `STORAGE_GB` Price for plan × currency | €3/GiB-month × bytes aged > 30d. Orgs on plain 30d retention bill €0 *by construction* — their TTL deletes rows before they turn 31 days old. |
| **SaaS Enterprise** | ✓ custom, per-project policies allowed | Custom | Custom Price on the same `STORAGE_GB` meter | Negotiated rate; same projection, same pipeline |
| **Self-hosted licensed** | ✓ **unlocked by the license** | Their infra, their disk | **None — never metered** | €0 — we do not host their data; the license gates the *feature*, not billing |
| **Self-hosted unlicensed** | ✗ | Platform default only | None | €0 |

**License = feature gate, not billing.** License holders get retention feature parity with Paid but are never attached to the storage meter. The entire pipeline (projection, command, audit table, catalog) is EE-only; OSS keeps only the existing `StorageMeterService` for the retention UI.

**Go-live is forward-only.** Metering starts at the projection's first sealed hour; no backbilling of past months. Existing customers holding beyond-30-day data start accruing from go-live — the customer notice must state this explicitly, and the SubscriptionItem backfill runs only after the notice, on the announced date.

### 6. Pricing: €3/GiB-month, binary, 30-day convention, single flat rate

```
unit_amount_decimal = €3 / 30 days / 24 hours / 1024 MiB-per-GiB
                    ≈ €0.00000407 per MiB-hour
                    = €0.10 per GiB-day
```

**Unit vocabulary:** all quantities are binary — values are MiB (`bytes / 1_048_576`), prices are per GiB (1024 MiB). Identifier names (`STORAGE_GB` meter, `storage_mb:` prefix, `megabytes` columns) use GB/MB as opaque labels only — renaming Stripe meters later is painful, so the labels stay and this line is the contract. Marketing copy must say GiB or accept the ~2.4% decimal-GB gap.

Stripe Price `unit_amount_decimal` is static — one fixed number applied to the period's summed MiB-hours. Holding 1 GiB all month therefore bills €3.10 in 31-day months, €2.80 in February, €3.00 in 30-day months (the AWS S3 / R2 convention; marketing copy must say so or switch to a flat per-day headline). Partial periods bill proportionally by construction.

The retention length chosen (60 vs 90) does **not** change the unit price — longer retention costs more naturally because more bytes live longer (more GiB-hours). One meter, one rate per plan; Enterprise rates are separate Prices on the same meter.

## Schema

One Prisma migration, two changes:

```prisma
// (1) Discriminate the existing checkpoint by meter so STORAGE_GB cannot
// collide with BILLABLE_EVENTS. Default backfills existing rows.
model BillingMeterCheckpoint {
  // existing fields …
  meterName String @default("BILLABLE_EVENTS")          // NEW — discriminator
  @@unique([organizationId, meterName, billingMonth])   // was (organizationId, billingMonth)
}

// (2) Durable per-hour measurement. The reporter drains reportedAt IS NULL
// and stamps on success. Per-hour audit trail + cursor for catch-up.
model StorageUsageHourly {
  organizationId String
  sealedHour     DateTime  // UTC, truncated to hour
  megabytes      Int       // ceil(bytes / 1_048_576), measured at sample time
  reportedAt     DateTime?
  createdAt      DateTime  @default(now())
  @@id([organizationId, sealedHour])
  @@index([reportedAt])
}
```

The audit table is the load-bearing fix for catch-up correctness: `StorageMeterService` is a stock read with no time-travel, so persisting each measured value per hour decouples *measurement* from *Stripe availability* — the reporter can stall and resume without re-measuring (and without re-billing).

No ClickHouse migration; `_size_bytes` exists.

`stripeCatalog.json` gains a `STORAGE_GB` meter entry plus one metered Price per (plan × currency × interval); `STRIPE_METER_NAMES` / `STRIPE_PRICE_NAMES` in `stripePrices.types.ts` get the new entries.

## Invariants

| Invariant | Meaning | How satisfied |
|---|---|---|
| **Idempotent** | Replays don't change totals | Deterministic `identifier = storage_mb:${orgId}:${isoHour}` (Stripe dedups ~24h) + `StorageUsageHourly.reportedAt` cursor for cross-day dedup. Same hour sent twice = one billed event. |
| **Deterministic (as-of sealed hour)** | Same source state → same answer | Rows are measured once; the reporter never re-measures. The CH predicate anchors to the sealed hour, not `now()`. Holds modulo TTL-eviction of far-edge rows in >35-day gaps. |
| **Explainable** | Invoice traces to raw measurements | `SELECT sealedHour, megabytes, reportedAt FROM "StorageUsageHourly" WHERE organizationId = $1 AND sealedHour BETWEEN $a AND $b` — the invoice line is the sum of that column. |

## Rationale / Trade-offs

**Stored (stock integral), not ingested (flow).** Helicone/Sentry bill ingest bytes; AWS S3/OpenObserve bill stored GiB-hours. Stored wins here because (a) the measurement already exists, (b) deletion lowering the bill is the customer-facing answer to the "report X then delete Y" question, (c) it makes retention a visible cost lever rather than a hidden internal optimization. Trade-off accepted: a customer who ingests 1 TB and deletes it within the hour pays ~€0 for it (S3 has the same property); ingestion cost we incur is unpriced. If that becomes an acquisition vector, an ingest fee is a *separate additional* line, never a replacement.

**Hourly additive accrual, not end-of-period reporting.** Each hour is independently correct, independently retryable (35-day backdate window), and immune to period-edge timing games. Data arriving one minute before month-end contributes one hour-sample (~0.001 GiB-month) — negligible and exactly fair. The failure mode of a monthly job (one failed run = one wrong invoice) becomes "some hours retry later".

**Predicate-encoded 30-day inclusion, not Stripe-side allowance.** The free window is `row_age > 30d` in the source query — one source of truth, provable with a test ("default-retention org reports 0"). A Stripe-side graduated tier-0 or credit grant would put the allowance in dashboard config that can drift from marketing copy. Trade-off: changing the window requires a deploy, not a config click. Accepted — the window is product policy, not a pricing knob.

**Time-based allowance, not volume-based.** "First 30 days free" rather than "first N GiB free". This is the commercial offer verbatim; no per-plan GB allowance state exists anywhere.

**Event-driven projection, not a cron.** A cron would be simpler in isolation but introduces a second operational model (leader lock, interval config, separate alerting) for the same shape of work `billingMeterDispatch` already does. Trade-off: idle orgs (no events) have their cursor frozen until the next event lands, then back-fill at catch-up time. Accepted — idle orgs' billable storage is by definition near-zero or being retention-deleted, and the 35-day ceiling bounds staleness.

**Rejected: mid-period snapshot of current GB.** Timing-dependent, non-reproducible, bills X regardless of deletions. Not one of the 11 competitors researched ships it.

**Rejected: `reportUsageSet` / `last`-formula meter.** Both telescope to the final value — gameable by deleting just before period close.

**Rejected: ingested-GB priced by retention tier (SigNoz model).** Most sophisticated, but blocks shipping and double-charges the retention lever (more hours *and* a higher rate).

**Rejected: usage-billing middleware (Metronome, Orb, Lago).** Would erase the GiB-hours integration work, but adds a third party in the billing critical path and net-new operational surface while we already run the meter→Stripe pipeline. Reconsider if billing complexity grows (commitments, credits, multi-currency tiers).

## Consequences

**Positive.**
- The bill is the time-integral of stored bytes at hour resolution: "pay for what you held, for how long". Deletion lowers the bill by construction — no rebate, no adjustment, no dispute surface.
- Reuse: one Prisma migration + one audit table + one projection + one command + catalog entries. Idempotency, circuit breaker, SaaS gate, observability — inherited.
- Zero rollout disruption: same subscription, same cycle; the storage line appears on the next invoice after notice + backfill.
- Free and self-hosted orgs generate zero pipeline activity.
- Per-project retention diversity inside an org needs no special handling.

**Negative.**
- Cancel/downgrade becomes a billing-correctness path: Stripe discards accrued metered usage on cancel unless `cancel_at_period_end` (default) or `prorate=true` + `invoice_now=true` (immediate). Existing cancel paths in `subscription.service.ts` must be audited; each flow gets an integration test asserting the final invoice line.
- The checkpoint discriminator migration swaps a unique index — brief `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` on `BillingMeterCheckpoint` (sub-second at current row counts; flag in runbook).
- Stripe's 35-day timestamp ceiling caps catch-up; longer projection outages need the `meterEventAdjustments.create` runbook path.
- Hourly catch-up means hourly CH queries per org per gap — bounded with the same memory-budget pattern as the existing storage-meter query (per-table-then-sum, no UNION ALL).

**Neutral.**
- 30-day-month convention → ±3% monthly variance vs a flat €3; pricing copy must specify GiB and the convention.
- 24× meter-event volume vs daily — negligible under Stripe's 1k events/sec.
- Cold/hot tiering (ADR-024) is internal cost optimization — one price regardless of where bytes physically live.

## Open questions (deferred, not blocking)

1. €3/GiB-month price point — confirm with pricing copy owner.
2. Customer notice copy + go-live date — gates the SubscriptionItem backfill.
3. Free plan's 14-day visibility / 45-day blurred recovery window — read-path concern, sibling spec (#4745), not billing.
4. `LimitType.storage` (soft notify vs hard cap) — follow-up PR.
5. Idle-org heartbeat (per-org synthetic event so cursors never freeze) — only if real orgs surface the gap.
